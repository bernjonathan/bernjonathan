"Last night I had another fight with my mother. Maybe it was not such a good idea to stay home for my first year of college. As far as I can see I have only brought her pain and no comfort. Although she does make several good points about my  unorthodox behavior, ultimately I am a grown man. If I told my friends that she tries to make me come home at a certain time  the result would be ridiculous. Not that opinions and thought of my buddies would really sway my mind, but many of them respect me for where I came from and what I have done. I've got a good job(insurance company $7. 80/hour), pay for my car, attend college,  help my mom at her beauty salon, and still have time to go out and party with them. My mother thinks that my constant ventures  to places she has never been will bring about my demise. Certainly there is no way I can deny about her role in my life. She has always been there for me and lately we have grown even closer, but I dont see how she can try and write my schedule out for me  according to her opinions. Recently our dog had 7 puppies and she spent much of the time caring for them and taking them to the vet. Six of the puppies have been sold, and the one that is left originally belonged to the mail dog's owner who changed their mind about  keeping it. so my mom blames me for not cleaning up after the puppy I dont even want. I tell her to give it away and then she  blames for being a cruel person in that we dont know what kind of person would get it. For a while now I have been looking for a female. And I dont mean just any ol' girl I can get plenty of those. But a lady who I won't get tired of after the first night in bed. There is  several ladies out there who I would like to be with, but for some reason it never turns out to be the way I thought. So I just go on  with flirting' around. Most girls I know think that I except something from them, but I'm simply trying to be friends. I guess thats  the rep I got at Anderson high. Maybe because of the people I hang with. Hopefully I've written enough, and if not here are some more  of my thoughts for the prof to analyze. In college I've tried to have different study habits then high school. In high school I could do  nearly nothing and still maintain a high average. Here I know this can not be done. this of course another concern of my mother. I can not dismiss actual reading and studying as not important at the university of Texas or I might end up with a poor man working for McDonaldss or begging for money on the drag. A few days ago I read (in the psychology book) that in order for your mind  to expand you must exercise it like a muscle. Interesting idea.              "
"Its really cool being able to see all of my friends and hang out. Yet, I feel like I'm somewhat out of place. It was really strange coming home yesterday. As soon as we came into town, it felt like I was in some kind of mirage. It was like I was dreaming and it still feels that way. I really need to do a lot of homework but I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot done, considering the circumstances. I went to our high school football game last night. Wow, was that strange. I saw some old friends and it just felt so strange. Its going to be even worse going back, because now that I've seen everybody I somewhat want to stay. But, on the other hand I need to go back, have to go back, and I do want to go back. I've met people and I still want to meet more people. I've had a lot of fun down there, and so I want to go back. I have too much homework now. Uhhh, that sucks. Well, the UT football game is on and they're already losing!  I guess it is UCLA, but come on guys. Oh well, I guess I'm supposed to be talking about my college experience. So, anyway, I don't know, I'm getting adjusted pretty well to the university. I love the campus. Absolutely, love it. The buildings, especially in the six pack, and with the view of the capital and the tower is just amazing. I'm from Dallas and the Austin area is just so much nicer and I feel so much safer. There's not a lot of places like that up here, but it seems like everywhere in Austin is like that. I've been down to the river, and it its so much better than our river up here, the Trinity. And the lakes in Austin are so clean and nice. Plus, there's so much to do. Which, is also somewhat of a bad thing, since its harder to get my work done with so much going on. Something that does seem really weird is that I can actually study better in my dorm room than I could in my own room here at home. I guess because I realize that in college, I'm paying for my education, so I'm taking it a lot more serious. I can't screw around now, and I actually do find myself wanting to learn. Surprise!  I actually sit in class and listen to the professor. I have a lot more respect for the teachers down here because I know that they know what they're talking about and I want to learn more. The whole is experience is so much different and better than high school, in my opinion. Coming back home, and seeing friends still in high school; I feel sorry for them. High school was fun and all, but college is fun, and I feel I'm getting a quality education. Plus, in high school, there's way too many people who just don't want to be there. And they have to act so stupid for some reason, and it was just extremely annoying. In college, everyone who's there is there because they want to be there. So, they're aren't people who just want to cause trouble and act stupid all the time. Food. What is the deal with the food at Jester?  I mean some of its good, but the main course is always terrible. Its cold and looks like something has infested it. But, to be fair, there is some good food, every once in a while. Home food. Now, there's a big difference. Mmm. Got to love it. That's got to be the best thing about coming home, at least one of them. Also, not having to worry about money is a great thing. I'm getting along great with my roommate. I had heard about all of these horror stories about roommates, so I was a little worried at first. But, I usually get along with most everybody, so I figured it would probably be ok. And it was. He's normal and listens to the same music as me. We're getting to be pretty good friends. The only thing I'm worried about now is the tests. Everyone keeps telling me that no matter how much I study some times I'll still fail. That worries me. I would like to think that if I know the material then I would pass the test. And so far, I really haven't had that much homework to do. I have had to read a lot, but I haven't had much writing work to do. I think I'm running out of things to talk about, or rather, think about. But, well, its been twenty minutes, and I guess I understand what this was all about. Plus, the UT game is on, and hopefully we can somehow, with the grace of God, pull off a win. I think that may be impossible though, so maybe then we can get some kind of close loss. Man, we are getting killed. Oh well, next week we get to play Kansas St. !  And they're only like, what, 5th in the nation. That's not so great right?  Out defense just plain sucks. I mean, I don't think I've ever seen such bad plays as what I'm seeing right now. But, hey, we've got Ricky though, so maybe he can pull off some kind of miracle. Yeah, its going to be one of those games that goes down in history because we came back and won. There, that's positive thinking. I think that's what the team needs the most. And if football can't do that great, we've still got some other great athletes in some other great sports. That's the great thing about UT, we've got so many sports that something's got to be good. And I love how there's like an organization for everyone, so that everybody fits in. The organizations are great because they make you feel more at home. You're able to be with people that you feel comfortable with. Ok, its been like way past twenty minutes so I guess I'm through. Uh, bye, I guess. "
"Stream Of Consciousness      As I sit behind this bleak, gray screen, I find myself wanting to yank my  dirty blonde locks of hair right out of their follicles. Sure, so far college has been a lot of fun. Why doesn't this program allow me to scroll down to  the next line without pushing ""enter""? Am I supposed to keep on typing without pushing ""enter"" until I hit some kind of barrier and can't type anymore?  Well,  I'm going to operate on the assumption that I should make my own right margin. Back to being completely stressed, I have so many things that I have to do  right now, that is, before tomorrow. So, why the heck am I doing this  assignment when I have until the 12th to turn it in?  I guess that's my nature. I tend to want to do the ""fun"" things first. If my mother could see me now, she would freak. I wonder what would happen if I got my upper ear pierced?  I bet my mom would kill me. She nearly freaked out when I had my belly button pierced. I feel extremely guilty for having done that behind her back, but I  feel even more guilty for upsetting her and ruining my innocence in her eyes. My roommate wants me to pierce her ear for her. I honestly don't think that I am capable of inflicting that kind of pain on another individual. Sure, I can  pierce my own bellybutton, but when I see another person in pain, I feel twice as bad as they most likely do. Oh well, I'll just give Tracy the money to go  have it professionally done. This pushing ""enter"" is really beginning to  frustrate me. I keep typing way over the right limit and having to erase and go back and re-type what I already typed. I think I need a computer. I  hate having to work and concentrate amongst all the hundreds of other people  here at the SMF (the Smurf. I smile everytime I hear that). I wanted to buy a computer, and I do have the money since I sold my motorcycle, not by my own  choice, but by my mothers. I realize that was a run-on sentence, but I'm not  about to go back and fix it. I wonder if anyone is actually going to read this or not. I'm just glad that I haven't had any demented thoughts since I have  started typing. Not that I have those often, but we all have certain weird  thoughts that we really don't care to admit having. At least, I hope so. I  bet whoever reads this is going to think that I'm a bad person. I'm really not. I like to think of myself as daring and thrill seeking. My mother likes to  think of me as unconventional and improper and borderline ignorant. So, here I am at UT to prove her wrong. I've taken a step in the right direction by joining a sorority. I think that should be fun as long as I can stay on the  good side of the girls in the sorority. It has been my experience that after  anyone has known me for a long enough period of time, they grow tired of my companionship and toss me aside like yesterday's trash. This is one of the most confusing and hurtful things in my life. I don't understand it. I think I'm  the nicest person that I know. I'm always willing to do things for others to  make them happy. I'm a great listener, and I put everything I've got into  everything that I do (friendships especially). I've been told that things will  change and that things will get better in college. So far, I've found that to  be very true. I've met so many wonderful people that I can't wait to know  better, but the first 18 years of my life has me trained to wonder how long it will be before they drop me. Oh well. my twenty minutes is almost over with and I have successfully typed myself into a foul mood. I really hope  no one reads this. I'm going to leave the Smurf, go back to Castilian and  enjoy being with my new friends while they still like me!    "
"My toes are kind of cold, no, they're very cold because this room is always frigid. At least I've got my flannel pants on that are so comfortable!  I love them. I could live in them. My T-shirt isn't too warm, but it's okay. I'm kind of wondering how I'm going to do this for 20 minutes straight. My thoughts kind of wander, but I'm not sure how I can record them for that long. I have a kind of upset feeling in my stomach right now. I think I'm just hungry. The rest of me is very relaxed because of the day I just spent out at Hamilton Pool, swimming and hiking. I loved the cold water that felt so good after the hot sun beating down on me in the car and during the hikes. The hikes were fun, though, because everything was so clean and clear, and it was fresh and refreshing. I wish my desk went back farther because I feel like the monitor is right in my face and it is too big for me to look at the whole thing. I would like a less-focused perspective on it, but I guess that's a dumb thing to say because it's nice to have a big monitor and it's not such a problem. People down the hall are getting kind of loud. It kind of annoys me when they talk really loud all over the dorm, but I guess it shouldn't because I could always just shut my door and it wouldn't be a problem. Plus, I know that I'm really loud a lot of the time, especially when friends come over and find my guitar, speaking of which, I need to get my guitar out of Dave's trunk so I can practice it because they're so much better than me at playing and if we're going to do music for the Happening, I need to be better. I'm wondering if I'm doing this assignment right. I mean, am I supposed to record what I think and feel right now, or if my mind wanders to tangents should I record that too?  I guess I'll just go with my stream of consciousness, like the assignment says. My fingers are going to get tired of typing. I feel like they are getting worn smooth by my fingers always tapping on them. I guess the real problem is that my fingers are cold so there is a kind of loss of sensation and they don't move so well right now. My fingers always get so cold during the winter, especially. I'm kind of dreading fall for that reason, but I love fall and winter, and I'm actually really excited about it. I wonder if I was reading this if I would think I am a negative person. I mean, the whole thing is about negative stuff: cold toes and fingers and stomach pains and annoying stuff going on around. I'm actually a really happy person, I don't know why I complain so much. I wonder if I do that in everyday conversation, too. I guess I'm kind of whiny, but I catch myself doing it so I stop-plus, people know that I'm not really serious about it, I just like to make noise sometimes. rrOoooh, I like popping my knuckles-there I go trying to be positive-it's funny that that's what I came up with to be positive. I just did it, and it helps them feel so much more movable, which is ironic because it'll probably give me arthritis and keep me from moving them when I get old. Oh well, it's a habit I can't seem to break. On my desk I have pictures of my cousins. They are so cute-the little ones, the older ones are just goofy and funny. I love them. Just looking at them makes me laugh about dumb stuff that we've done. There is also a picture of my little sister making a really silly face into the camera. She's in her bathing suit, wearing goggles and everything. Everybody laughs at that picture, including me. There is also pictures of a church retreat I did called Happening. I love those pictures because that was probably the best week of my life and those people are probably my best friends in the world-except for my family because family has always known me and will always be there. I'm so glad that I'm saved. I used to never use that phrase bc I thought it was cheesy and overzealous, but it's so true. Where would my life be without Christ?  I just don't know. He brings me so much joy that it's overwhelming. I wish I could share that with everyone who has never felt it, but some people don't want to hear it. that's too bad because I know people who need Christ (well, we all do, but I mean people who complain about a void in their life that they don't know how to fill) and they're the ones who I most want to tell about Him, but there is such an attitude in society that you just don't  ""preach"" to other people, and they would resent it if I tried to tell them. They don't realize that I just want to share-""I know it can do it for you-you've got to know what it did for me. "" (song lyrics) but I'm labeled as one who judges-funny thing is that they're the ones who are judging me. My intentions are pure. It's not like I'm on commission-one extra year in Heaven for every person you bring to Christ-I just care about people and the Lord, and I want to serve Him and help them. It's the truth, you know?  If only I could just tap my experience into people so they wouldn't doubt me or think I'm false or that I'm just trying to glorify myself because I'm not. ""What do I care about pleasing men?  If I wanted to please men, I would not be a servant of God. "" Gal 1:10 That's Reagan's favorite verse. Hmmm, I wonder if Reagan is back in town yet. He went home for his dad's birthday this weekend. I should call him tonight, and now my 20 minutes are up so I can do that!  wow, that went fast. it's kind of scary how fast that went! "
"     Usually when you know that you have to do something, you usually think about that something, you usually think about that something and wonder, ""How am I going to do it?  Where do I start?  Where do I finish?  How do I know that I am doing it right?""  This is my situation exactly with this writing assignment. Its the middle of the week and the weekend is almost here. I can't wait till Saturday because I will attend the first UT football game this season, which I might add, will be my first time to attend one. The weeks go by so slow in the fall semester compared to when I was up here for summer school. Its a real drag. I'm always so tired I hate it. Labor day is this weekend, really looking forward to the four day weekend and getting some time to rest. Maybe I'll go visit Brett (an El Paso friend) at the hidious A & M, College Station, the drive is a drag though. The road trip that me and Lianne went on last weekend to go visit up there was sort of fun, but people down there are really rude and it just bugs the hell out of me. All they're concerned about is putting UT down or ""TU"" as they call us since we're not ""THE"" University of Texas but ""A"" Texas University!  Isn't it stupid. Still admit I'm upset about them breaking the horns of my longhorn emblem on my car. Its sad how immaturity can get the best of people. They do have a lot of school spirit. Makes me wish that I was into that stuff. Who knows, maybe when all the football games start. I want to see how crazy us Longhorns really get. I can't wait till softball games start, I want to see all their home games to see what it takes to be on the team!!  Hopefully next year, after a lot of hard work and practice to get back into it, I will be ready to try out. I'm really discouraged about trying out this year, I know I'm not ready. My family's encouragement helps but I don't want to make a fool out of myself. I can just imagine being out on the field suited out in a UT uniform. How amazing. That is my goal!!  If I can be one of the best players in my city, why wouldn't I have a shot on the team. I just think that I lack a lot of skill to be playing at the university level. It may be outstanding for high school, but college ball is a totally different game. I love being away from home to go to school, there is so much more freedom. Don't have to be home at a certain time, don't have to check in. I love it. There are a lot more responsibilities though, but I'm picking up on the time management. The Incubus concert is coming up and I'm (since yesterday) going. I've only heard a few songs by them so I can't say that I'm an ""all out"" fan of theirs. But hey I'm open to the experience, it's going to be my first real concert. I should really save my money, but hey, why not just do it. Its worth the experience. "
"     Well. I just finished my first week of college. I can't believe I'm already here, but I wish I was already out. There seems like so much to do but I'm starting to get things under control. I think. My friend Helen is at A&M and shes going to jump for the track team. She is an emblem of success. everytime I think of her, it reminds me of just how bad of a person I am. I guess everyone makes mistakes, but my mistakes seem to be a lot worse when I make them, because I know better. Hopefully  I can keep up with all my reading assignments. reading is definitely not my thing. especially when I'm forced to do it. Tomorrow's reading time will be flled with the SI class, but that's okay I think I'm going to need as much help as I can get. Tonite's church. thank the Lord. Sometimes you just got to get filled up when everything seems so dry. I love church, but sometimes I feel so . . I don't know. not as good as everyone else. like nobody makes mistakes but me. I know that's not true. only I lie from the devil trying to get me down. anyways today in psychology class someone mentioned obessive cumplusive disorders. and I wanted to scream out. I've been caught in that trap beofre. Which I have and thank the Lord I no longer am bound by that chain. only by the grace of God did I get through some of the worst, tearful, confusing years of my life. Oh. El Patio sounds real good right now. not only because of the delicious food, but because I have to right a paper on it and I need to get some intricate details to make my paper a success! I can't wait to be home tonite. I've been up at school since before 7 am. only to realize that my 8 am class had been canceled. my next class was not until 12 noon. Oh well at least I got some studying in and I was able to finish my english homework so that I wouldn't have any tonite. Praise the Lord. Anyways back tonite. my boyfriend is suppose to call me about ten. man I hope he gets his own phone soon. I miss him. I wish could just get married right now. but my father might have other plans for that situation. . but I don't understand sometimes. why do you always have to wait 'til your outa school before you get married. . of course I understand the logical part of it all, but what about love. although love is suppose to be patient. I don't like preaching to myself all the time. it's like I know what's right but I wish things could be different. I don't know. right now my biggest concern is my dad letting me drive down to San Antonio and pick up Stephen (my boyfriend) on friday afteroon. oh Lord please help me to find favor with him on this situation. Wow. twenty minutes is a lot longer than I thought it was going to be. It's like writing in my journal on the computer. what Dr. Pennebaker said today about when your depressed, to write what your feeling down. I totally agree. I know no matter what I'm feeling it always helps to write in my journal and shed a few tears of course! I like journals soo much that lately, I've been giving them to my friends for their birthdays. my time is clicking down. I really hope I can find a job soon and hopefully my friend Lauren found one today. "
"     what classes do i take next semester?  i need to plan out the rest of my college coursres out today. can i do it?  is it too much for me?  i think i can do it. i am completely capable of being admitted into medical school. thus far, i know that that is what God has in store for me, and what he thinks I should do now. there are so many people out there that i want to reach out to and help. i can not wait until my missions trip to russia. it wil be an awesome experience. everytime i think of all the people and children I will be helping i get a warm, tender, and comforting feeling in my heart. i think that God has given the gift of helping and taking care of others. for an extended period of my life i have always tried to find the meaning of my life, what special characteristics i possess but now i do not ponder on those things. i know that God has blessed me with several things and I am truly grateful. i hope that i can get involved with a good church here, and find a really nice cell group to join. i miss houston, newlife, house church. i wish that i could have stayed in houston and went to school there but i believe that i am where i belong. even though i may not like it here, i know that it is for the best. i believe that i will receive the best education i need for my profession in the future. plus, who knows, I may get more involved in church here in austin, and that may be another reason God has brought me here. nevertheless, i am determined to work far and beyond to be able to do my job. i am so tired today. i feel very tired but i can not seem to go back to sleep. it seems like every second is precious and i do not waste it by sleeping, atleast during the day. i am so nervous. it is only the third day of school and i am already stressing out. i think that i need to lighten up a little. my sister is right. i worry about things too much. i should just be easy-going but not too easy-going, i do not want to be carefree about everything. i am very thankful that i have naeri and my sister here. since i do not know many people in austin, it helps to atleast have one or two people i can talk to once in a while. i want to meet new people but the people here seem too immature for me. i am not really into the clubbing, drinking, etc. but then again there are so many students here, and i have only met the people that are into that because the people that i know are, so i just tag along. i am pretty sure that i will meet numerous people that share the some interests and aspects as i do. but i do not mind being alone. i think i am pretty independent exept for the fact that my parents my tuition but other than that i feel pretty independent. and, i also work and communicate well with others.  "
"I had just returned from other interesting dinner experience at my frat house when I realized that I was just wasting time as usual. So I decided I'd turn on the old computer and do a little stream of consciousness writing. I'm sitting down at my knew desk, that to tell you the truth, has done me no good except for a good place to put my computer. My roommate, an old friend I've know throughout my life is out doing his fraternity B. S. and probably won't be back until twelve. This I really do think is funny because coming into school I was completely busy from day one, while he just sat on his beanbag chair and watched t. v. To tell you the truth all I really care about any more is the amount of time I get to spend sitting in my beanbag chair watching t. v. Although it's not really as fun as it may seem, because while sitting in the beanbag chair the only thing on your mind is when you're going to have to get up and go do stuff. I realized today in class that when one begins to get about half the amount of sleep that he used to get it does become a little bit irritating and depressing. All I can think about is when I can rest may days have turned from full productive days with good night sleeps over the summer to half ass, sit around and make up excuse my I shouldn't leave the room so I can get some sleep worthless days. I'm pretty sure that last sentence made absolutely no sense, so on that last thought I think  I'm going to leave the room for the umpteenth time today and go do things that I really wish I could accomplish by getting into bed and closing my eyes. "
"     oh boy, the first writing assignment. I hope I am doing this correctly. I can't really think of anything else right now. I sort of have a slight headache. todays speech class was very boring. I am still bored because of it. sitting down and listening to one person after another talk and talk still has me a little bored. what else can I say. I am still bored because of it. my mind is still a blank. I don't know what I feel. my apt is sort of warm right now, so I guess its a little warm in here. I can hear my computer buzzing above everything else. I guess that can start to get annoying after a while. oh man, its only been two minutes thus far. 20 min of writing sure will suck. well, I still don't know what to think. I'm still bored. I'm now starting to think about a friend of mine. a special friend, who's company I enjoy very much. she lives back home in houston, and I occasionally see her on the weekends, although I've been talking to her online quite a bit lately. she is definetly someone special. now I'm thinking about another friend of mine who is over at my apartment constantly. although this guy is a friend of my roommates, he is also a friend of mine, but through our mutual friend. he's always over, always. this guy can get annoying, and when ever he comes over, he just annoys us. I'm a little annoyed just thinking about him right now. now my mind has drifted to ice cream. we all had ice cream last night. it was good stuff, but I think I had a little too much. we went to cold stone creamary on the drag. now my mind has drifted to the ice that is still sitting in the freezer. its just a little pint of bluebell ice cream. that pint has been sitting there for about a week and a half now. now my mind has drifted to my dad, who paid for that ice cream when I when I bought it using his credit card account. I guess I thought of him because he would smack me for going out to eat ice cream when there is perfectly good ice cream at home. now my mind has shifted to another friend of mine who just called me a minute ago, but I ignored his call because I am doing this writing assignment. this guy is a cool guy, I like him. he went to my high school and now goes to school in san antonio. his girlfriend goes here to ut. he's probably coming up to see her and to hangout with me and my roommate. now my mind has shifted to a looser guy I know that my friend from san antonio doesn't like. this other guy also goes to school in san antonio. these two almost got in a fight two weeks ago, and although I'm a passivist, I hope my friend and this other guy duke it out, for the other guy is also coming to austin this weekend for god knows what reasons. I thought it was funny seeing the two argue, and almost fight. although if the two were to fight, I think my friend would beat his ass. now thinking of san antonio, my mind has shifted to some other buddies of mine that live and go to school in san antonio. some of these guys went to high school with me as well, some didn't. I wonder how they're doing. its been a while since I last talked to almost any of them, and I just wonder how they're doing. maybe I should go up there sometime. although I have been saying these exact words for almost a year and a half now. oh boy, another  seven minutes to go. damn that's a long time. I'm still thinking about my buddies from san antonio. now I'm thinking about a friend that went to ut, from san antonio, who unfortunetely flunked out of ut. I think his parents weren't too happy about it, because I've heard they've enforced some harsh rules for this guy to live by. now another friend called me, but I ignored his call as well. now I'm thinking about my friend who just called me. this guy I've know for almost 18 or 19 years, quite possibly one of my earliest friends. he just graduated from ut last semester and is already engaged. I'm sort of both happy for him and sad at the same time. happy because he'll be married and doing what is expected of everyone to do to get their wheels in life rolling. yet sad becuase I know things will be different once he's married. for example, he won't be able to hang out quite as much, although I'm sure his wife will be more than happy to let him go out every now and then. and also becuase he'll have other things on his mind that a married man would have and just probably won't feel like screwing around with his buddies any longer, or rather at the same level of screwing around he did in his college days. what ever the future holds for him, I know he'll be happy, and for that reason, I too am happy, for him that is. well, its about another two minutes to go, I hope that this will end soon. and now I see that my friend is washing the dishes that belong to my roommate and I, which I don't thin she should do. I think I'll stop her when I'm done wtih this assignment. another couple of seconds to go till I'm done. yippie. "
"Well, I don't know where to begin. I guess it started when she came over for lunch. I never would have know what great thing was going to happen that strange windy day. She swooped in and plopped herself on my new Pappason chair. She was so gracious to bring me a freshly baked apple pie. As she poured all of her energy into describing a new dress she had found in the Hit or Miss store I noticed it. How her eyes had a strange twinkle about them. I mean, don't get me wrong Randy is the best friend I have ever had, and her eyes always shone, but for some reason today, they almost glowed. As she began to finish her story a serene silence filled my small living room. It was barely noticeable that my over grown Lab  Dixie had trampled into the room wearing half of the back yard. Then the words just fell out of her mouth. ""He's come to rescue me, and I'm going to go. "" I have never felt such a mixture of relief, happiness, utter joy and somehow an utter ripping in my soul. I was loosing the best thing that had ever happened to me. My best friend was on her way to her life long dream. All I could do was cry and hug her. Then she started crying and we were just an absolute mess. There was no other sensible thing to do besides get that apple pie and slap some vanilla ice cream on it and CELEBRATE! Wow. She's gone. What is left of me? I sat around my quaint little home, breathed the clear air and wept all my emptiness out. I mourned the loss of my closest and dearest friend for. I don't know how long. It seems like a whole season passed. Then one day, I got tired of crying. I knew that deep inside there was something in me that drew that wonderful friendship and I'd be darned if I was going to let it rot inside of me. So, I did what any normal person would do to seek selffulfillment. I joined a club. I went to every dang meeting any time those doors were open. But you know what, I didn't find it. So, I began to search books in the library on sewing, butterflies, architecture toadstools, anything and everything that seemed of some minute interest to me. I left the library with so many books, my arms almost fell off. But, no that was not my answer. sigh you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to meet myself a man. I will find out what love is all about, and I mean real love. So, take that! Thus, my Man Hunt began. I browsed the Video Dating services, the internet (big mistake, HUGE), I scoped men at the grocery store, I bought some roller blades and tried out Hike and Bike trails, but nope, nothing'. Oh, I met men all right, but the kind of guys I met made me want to swear off of them forever. Yet, something was in me that just kept popping up over and over and over again. He's out there, my Prince is going to come rescue me, I just have to have faith in real love. After some serious time had passed, I stepped out of my life and looked at what I had, and noticed that my Many Hunt had taken over every part of me, and nothing that was left was desirable, even to me. So I just plum gave up. I was not going to let this hole in my heart rule my life. And that was it. So, I dropped all of my memberships and subscriptions and just began to spend time alone, and then I began to pray. It helps so many other people, why not me? you know what happened when I shut myself alone in my room with nothing but some soft music and candle light? My heart was completely and totally overflowed with peace. How in the world can the words I choose let you know about my sweet experiences with the Lord? He is the absolute perfect gentleman. I began to talk with Him every day. I began to listen for His voice and I began to find Him everywhere I went. I realized, I was never alone. I was being filled with love that brought me over and through every little thing that would try to bring me down. The lord God in Heaven loves me, and I love Him. And you know what else, after I gave my heart to Jesus, I met Mark. Would you believe that he was walking by my house with his 2 Great Danes and was stopped to tie his shoe as Dixie bolted out my front door. We met, just that simply. He has arrived at my front door now, so I better go. We are on our way to Jamaica oh how I love to be rescued! "
"     For the past two weeks, I've been down here in Austin, TX, home of the largest university in the nation, and while I thought that I would have the time of my life, I cannot seem to move past the feeling that I am completely alone in a world of 50,000 students. I had wanted to come to this university for five years, but now that I'm here, im constantly thinking of ways to either get out or somehow to get used to it. The fact is, I left my friends. Although this is something that everyone going to college is faced with, the friends I left were the only ones that I had kept for more than 4 years since my family moved around often. And this time, leaving them was actually my decision!  I continually tell myself to just give it time and I will find my place. However, as I struggle being in a new city by myself, it seems that everyone that I talk to is having the time of their lives:  the time that I wanted and expected to have upon arrival in Austin. Wanting to transfer closer to where my friends are occuppies much of my thoughts each and every day. I just can't move past it. It's as if the world is moving on without me. I feel as if I'm lost, and I don't know how to find myself again. Either I stay here and attempt to find the dream I had expected, or I find a way out of the city. Everyone seems so happy. Why can't I be like them?  I miss everything about my home, but most of all I miss how familiar everything was. I knew what was going to happen every day, and here, I don't know what to do with  myself!  Anyway, I really wish my roommate would come home every now and then!  I hardly see her. I miss my boyfriend so much!  I sound like such a typical teenage girl in saying that, but it's true. I miss my life before college. I hadn't realized how happy and lucky I truly was to have such amazing friends and family close by all the time. Perhaps I just need to get out there and truly find someone to talk to, but it feels like I've tried that already. I wish so much that I could just meet someone and right away have a friend! It's ridiculous to think that way, but honestly, the world would be a much friendlier place!  Okay, so now it seems like I'm just rambling on. I should go running sometime soon, but it's extremely hot outside!!  I cannot wait for this weekend because I have a ride home. See, I continually come back to this topic. I desperately hope that I maintain the same relationship with my friends. I feel so stressed out lately. I don't know what to expect yet from college, and calculus is absolutely killing me!  If I don't get an extremely high GPA, I might HAVE to transfer universities in order to get accepted into business. Why couldn't my life have just stood still during my senior year of high school?  I loved it, only I didn't know that I had the life I always wanted until I was forced to leave it and start over. I sound as if my life is falling apart, and it's not. Sometimes I just feel too overwhelmed with making new friends and meeting new people, keeping in touch with everyone and wishing they were here with me, and then there's the little fact that I'm supposed to decide what to do with the rest of my life at some point soon!  Business is just so general, so I thought it would be a great starting point. Who knows?  Definitely not me. I'm so confused right now. People are outside running right now. I should get out there and attempt to keep in shape. "
"I don't know what I should be doing right now. I mean life is so complicated and strange to me. My father says I can do whatever I want to at university and he will be happy with it, but the thing is if I do what I want then he would be pretty upset with me. Hell, he would disown me. I don't know why I have to do things in order to please him but I have to. Its like I have no choice. I am just starting to get his trust back and I don't want to lose that little bit that I have. You could say that I'm destined to do what other people want me to do. That is the way that society is these days. We are all conformed to a certain structure in life that we have to follow; and if we don't conform then we are outcasts and shunned by society. The ""norm"" they call it. Why does there have to be a ""norm"". I don't see why we can't live the way that we choose and be free. Oh well, back to happy thoughts. Amanda. There is a happy thought. I wonder. I wonder what?  I don't know. I guess I wonder if it will work. I'm nuts about he she is nuts about me, but we don't get to see each other as much as we would like. I guess that is true about a lot of couples. But I still don't know. What I do know is that I want to stay together, even though everyone is talking about us. I don't care how old she is. Hell, she is only 2 years younger that me so that doesn't matter. People are just making a big deal out of it because I am in college and she is a sophomore in high school. She is still a lot more mature than a lot of people older than me. She understands a lot of things. I guess that is because she grew up in Saudi. People there are generally more mature than people here in the states. We are forced to grow up faster than people here. We lose our innocence faster, and have to learn about the world and society as a hole much quicker. Lets leave it on this note. These are strange days that will challenge our true selves. I wish I could go deeper than that but I'm not going to spill all of my guts to a computer. Later babe. "
"Okay, here we go. This should be fun. I just got done eating. I spent 4 dollars on lunch. I am whittling away at my alloted 1200 dollar food stockpile. Anyway, i don't think that will last the whole year. Maybe one semester at the most. Anyway, my classes are all over today except for BA101, but that class is more of a joke. I was playing football last night and i jammed my right ring finger and it is extremely swollen right now. It feels like i need to pop it but it hurts too much for that. I also stubbed my big toe and bent the nail back about one third of the way. If you've never done that before, i fully recommend it. It feels wonderful. I should be taking a nap. Thats how I like to pass time. When i start reading, I usually end up falling asleep anyway. I have my first test of the year on tuesday. Its a microeconomics test. I seem to have a good understanding of economics so far. Maybe thats because I took it last year at my local community college. I was learning it pretty well until my teacher died midway through the semester. After that I learned nothing and my entire grade was based on a paper i wrote about rising gas prices for the summer. My finger is throbbing somewhat. I don't think I broke it, its just really swollen. I wish I could get a go-kart or something to drive to class. All this walking and such is tedious. I really should catch up with my reading. I have 3 classes that I need to read for regularly, and i am falling behind. I liked the weather yesterday. There was a grey sky, and it was rainy all day. I used to live in Washington, so I am used to rain. Its fun when it rains a lot, and you jsut have to stay in all day. Its not so much fun when it rains a lot, and it starts to flood. Wow, 20 minutes seems like a long time. Of course, if i weren't doing this, i probably would be sleeping. 20 minutes of sleep is nothing. Thats for amateurs. I go for hour increments. I withdrew $60 from an ATM last weekend and i don't really know where i spent it all because i only have 3 left. I didnt buy that much stuff i don't think. Oh well, its only money (right. ) I am looking forward to UT's next football game. The one against North Texas was crazy. People act so mob-like at those games. Everyone wears orange, everyone yells the same things. It almost like we've been brainwashed. Thats what TV does. Without us realizing, it plants little idioms and messages in our head. And another thing thats funny is how the least contributing people to our society are held the highest. For example, athletes, entertainers. etc. There roles in our world are purely excessive yet they control the wealth and are looked up to as if they are supreme. One thing i think is stupid is when people ask the famed for autographs. They are just normal people! Would you ask me for an autograph if you saw me walking down the street? Thats doubtfull. But when Frank from Survivor Africa is seen in San Francisco, surely people recognize him and ask him for autographs. People find solace in the stupidest things. I have ventured away from talking about how much time I have left and began venting. Now time is almost up. 15 seconds left. . 5 okay time is up and my stream of consciousness is beginning to fade. My bed is calling to me. "
"I am watching mtv cribs with Chris Pontius. Today was hot and I'm supposed to go running with Nathan but it's still too hot so I want to go later. Maybe I'll get some of my work done before then so I won't stay up so late like I have been lately. I'm really tired so I took a nap today and slept like a rock. I don't know when I'm going to supper though because I don't want to eat before I work out or I'll feel sick so I might just get Nathan to cook for me tonight. I am starting to miss everyone from back home because I'm not usually away from my family, friends, and Sam for this long. I guess I will just have to wait a couple more days to go home for labor day weekend. I want to go home to see everyone but I really don't want to go to the football game and that's what all of my friends are going to want to do. I'm running out of things to think about because the TV is on and it's distracting me. The song on this commercial is going to be in my head now for the rest of the day. I like all my classes so far but I'm still kind of scared. Especially about biology because my prof is going really quickly over the information and it's hard to stay up with him. I'm getting tired looking at this computer screen. my eyes are getting droopy but I can't get tired and go to sleep now because then I won't get anything done and I won't be able to sleep well tonight. just like last night I couldn't fall asleep forever and then when I finally fell asleep I kept waking up so I felt like I didn't sleep at all. my strawberry smoothie was really good just now. I'm kind of hungry but lately I haven't felt that good so I don't feel like eating. Maybe ill just wait until later when my roommate wants to go so I'll have someone to sit with. I hate going to the cafeteria without knowing someone because then I sit with people I don't know and we're always eating so we can't really talk with food in our mouth but I want to meet them and not be rude. I'm sure they understand because here at hardin house all the girls are really sweet. they are all in sororities though and me and my roommate Madison are they only 2% not in one. oh well I have way too much school work and other stuff to do and I know if I would have rushed I wouldn't have time for anything else and I really need to do good this first semester and get it behind me and get used to everything. My back has been hurting a lot lately because of an injury from track season but I can't get into a back specialist for a while so I kind of just have to live with it. and I love to exercise but it hurts me for days afterwards. I decided that I'm just going to start working out and if it hurts oh well because I really don't want to gain the freshman fifteen. ha. my boyfriend goes to school in Lubbock at Texas tech and it feels so different not being able to see each other everyday like we used to. it seems like we fight every day no matter what and yesterday was our one year anniversary so I went and got him a present Saturday with my mom at the mall in san Antonio. she wanted me to go back to Hondo with her just for the weekend because her and my dad missed me but I wanted to come back up here for the weekend and party with some of my friends. my parents got to see my yesterday though. they came up after lunch with my grandparents and they brought even more stuff for my dorm room. my mom has been keeping herself busy at home by being creative and making cute things to decorate with but I really enjoy when she brings me stuff. we went to eat at hula hut on lake Austin and it was really good like seafood/Mexican food. I've never had a shrimp enchilada before then but it was great and my dad ordered an awesome dessert tray that we all shared and loved. then we went out on the deck and watch all the people on the lake and just talked for a while. "
"like how my day was, yeah, I woke up real early today, likie 800 and theres still ab unch of people walking in and out of my room like this one girl who likes my roommate, and I know I left my last topic right in the middle but illcome back, so anyway, this girl that just walked into my room like my oommate, and she seems really nice, and shes cute enough, but someone told my roommate that shes not cute and now he doesn't like her, now I must concede that in the past, I've realized that girls aren't as beautiful as I originally thought, bcause someone else told me they didn't think so and I relized id been projectin something on the girl, or looking a little too hard for something that's not there, so I shouldn't judge or somethinng like that and and so I woke up for an 830 class this morning, and it was a Cal stuy session that was completely pointless, I miss my high school calculus class, I miss my high school cal teacher, she was a very good teacher, I ad lot of those in high school, so I guess I'm pretty lucky, but she was a really good teacher, and a lot of my friends in the class got together ad had a great study group, because, well for many reasons, first of all they werent my best friends, thy were three girls and my brohter, but they werent my best friends, and so I didn't have to worry too much about getting too off topic at the biegginning of the year with stupid inside jokes, we could just study, and later onwhen we became better friends, we could talk for hours about iomportant stuff, or reminice, and still know when to crachk down and actually study, also like I said the teacher was just great, I'm going back this weekend and since its labor day we don't have school on monday so I may just skip school tuesday and stay home to  go back and visit some of my old teachers, and I've only got 6 more minutes of writing, but I really think thatd be nice, uhh I'm out of tuff to say again, and everyone is babbling in the background, and I'm trying to tune him out, or them out, but now I'm losing total train of thought and so I'm going to start babbling again or risk having to stop all together and so I don't have any more classes today and I'm struggling here and my roommates playing playstation, so I went and worked out the other day, actually yesterday, and it was the first time in 4 months, but I'm going running and weight liftin again today, and I havent run in about the same length of time and so I'm sorta worried about taht, but I'm looking forward to it to, getting a little chubby you know, so I'm starting to work out 6 days a week, about one to two hours a day, and I'm worried is going to but a strain on my homework, but I've always been able to to manage time in the past and I just noticed that I've got less than aminute and now I'm done so I'm wrapping up saying goodbye if you ever read this, I ope you enjoyed this little window into my head "

"As I sit here and drink this very nasty coffee. (coffee maker is on the fritz) I look back and recollect on this past weekend. In fact this has been my only thought since Monday morning. So I can give you can better understand what I am talking about, I will give you  a background premise to what occurred. I was sitting on the computer, as always, talking to my boyfriend in Houston on a chat group. He and I are still in that ""newlywed"" phase of a relationship, so we are constantly wanting to be around the other. My having to be a couple hundred miles away in school is causing major distance pains. Any way, I was trying to encourage him to come visit me for the weekend. He was regretfully working on both Saturday, and Sunday lunches ( he is a waiter, where we met this past summer) . He replied to my requests with a request for me to go down there. I thought about it for a brief moment, decided that I had no major plans for the weekend, and immediately called Greyhound. I was on the next bus home, in one hour. He was so completely surprised. As he put it, it was one of the largest signs of love that he had ever been shown, for someone to just up and leave on the spur of a moment, spend over $50 that he knew I didn't have to spend, sacrifice a weekend of my time, just to see him. He was on cloud nine, and as soon as I saw him, so was I. Well the weekend progressed, and I had a wonderful time. I also had a chance to meet up with my friends still in Houston, without having to report in to my mother. thankfully I neglected to tell her that I was in town. Well, on my last day there, before my ride to the bus station, he and I had a heartfelt conversation. He basically proclaimed his undying love for me, and told me exactly how special I was in his life. He also went over all the things that I did to let him know how much he knew that I love him. He remembered all the little things that I have done since day one. which really meant something to me cause I know that my actions are received with such appreciation. He felt that this last one, my coming to see him on the spur of a moment, was the ultimate. He then proceeded to tell me of a mental list that he had of who he envisioned his wife would be, what kind of person she would be, and what her traits would be. He told me that I fit every one, and he said that I was his perfect companion. Both of us have seen a lot, and have dated almost every type of person out there. I know that he is the one for me, I have known it for a while. I have been told that when you meet that certain someone, you will know it is them, and you will know that they are the right one for you. Well. my mind, heart and soul are screaming at me that Terrence is him. Well, I stated a few things to him that I had been thinking about, and at one point,  I started to cry, out of sheer joy at what he was saying to me, I have never had any one person ever express their feelings to me, and I don't think I have ever experienced love at this level. I was so happy that the tears just came. Oh. to explain the next thing, I want you to know that we have talked, hypothetically about marriage several times in the past. but it was usually never in a fully serious tone, only half serious. but each of us was contemplating it. When he saw me crying, he embraced me so tightly, and with such warmth I felt at totally peace, at that moment, he whispered (and I still don't know if I was meant to hear t or not) that he had ""finally found his wife"". he pulled back from the embrace, looked so deep into my eyes that it felt as if he touched my soul, and right then and there, asked me to be his wife. I was soo taken aback that I couldnt speak. I have never been proposed to, and wasn't sure how to respond. All I could do was smile one of the biggest smiles I have ever made, and I replied yes. He said that he was completely serious. no hypothetical at all. he also said that he would ask me again, but this time, would present me with a ring. I know that it could be a while before he can get up the money for that. but I am willing to wait for a man like that. I have never meat anyone quite like him. I have only been in love 2 times before. one lasted for 3 years. but it ended as an abusive relationship. the second was only a one sided love. He was leaving for the Marines, and didn't want to return the love because he knew that he would come out a different person. But both times cannot even compare to my feelings for Terrence. Now I come to my contemplations. I had plenty of time to think about my life and where it was going on the bus ride home. I know that I want to spend my life with Terrence, he and I share the same values, we are both religious people in our own ways. we may not go to church regularly, but we are both at peace with God and what He asks of us. I have never met anyone that was religious and not afraid to admit it, but he isn't overly religious to the point that I am disgusted. :O)  We both have the same values regarding marriage. in effect, neither of us believes in divorce. Marriage is for all time, and if you marry a person then it is forever. ""'til death do you part""  I know that this could work. The biggest obstacle that I can see is the age gap. he is 28, I am 18. It hasn't posed a problem for us before, my mother likes him, and sees that he shows acceptable behavior, and treats me with the utmost respect. He never belittles me, or disregards what I say because I am young. In fact he looks up to me because I have set such high goals for myself, and will stop at nothing to achieve them. He also knows that I want to wait until graduation, or at least close to it, before I get married. And he knows how important Med-school is to me. He also says that he will not marry me until he knows for sure that he can support me. he is one of those chivalrous guys, that believes that a man should be able to support a family on his salary alone. but if his wife wants to work, or even makes more money than him, then he is all for it. he just wants to be able to know that I don't have to work. At the same time, he is giving me more support about being a doctor than any other person. including my family.  One thing that bothers me is that he is 28 and still a waiter. I know that it is only temporary, he is working for a career in music, either with a band, as a musical engineer/producer, or as a teacher (he is one of the best drummers I have heard. and writes INCREDIBLE music. everything from piano pieces, to synthesized complete modern music. he can do it all!!!!  I know that with my income alone, we can make it. even starting out, being a doctor will be able to support us. The problem could arise in the fact that we will be in debt for a while, paying off med-school, and it would be a shaky start. But of course all marriages start out financially shaky. I am also concerned that because he is so much older, and more ready to settle down, that he will encourage me to marry before I graduate. that would just be another added expense. By the time I graduate, he will be 31. I just hope that he can wait that long. he says that he can, and that he will, I believe him, but he may grow antsy as the years go on.  Bottom line is that I love him, and will do anything in the world for him, but of course within reason. I also know that he would do the same for me, without even needing me to ask. I have never felt this way about any other human being. and I don't think that another love like this is possible. besides I don't want any one else but him. soo. Yes, I will marry him. and we will have beautiful children. We know that once this ""honeymoon"" feelings wear off. our love for each other will change. but as I know my love, I will still be there. by his side. I have never met anyone that completes me, and who I am, so perfectly as he does. not even my best friend. Terrence and I connect we realized this when we first met, and had our first deep discussion. In fact we connected to each other so well. that it scared both of us. and with reason. when you meet someone and the next week you can complete each other sentences. and already know what the other is thinking without them having to say a word, it can be a bit scary. But as we grew, we grew more comfortable with the idea. and now he is ready to marry me. my life couldnt be more perfect, and I couldn't be any more happier. I am in love. and now, I am engaged!! "
"It was very frustrating to get on to the web site. However, the weekends are fun. I get to see my friends that are not at this school. This weekend I went home to see one of my friends who signed with the Kansas City Royals. I also got to see two of my best friends that are guys. One goes to TCU and the other goes to Tomball Community college. He was supposed to go to Georgia to swim, but two days before school started, he called, and they told him that his spot on the team was gone. Now he is writing other colleges and the Yale coach called him. If he does not swim, he will probably come here next semester. I also got to see my boyfriend. He goes to Baylor. He was my best friend first and now we are together. It is great. However, I miss him a lot. He is the sweetest guy I know. Anyway, right now I am borrowing a friends computer because mine doesn't work. It is really a pain. I need to go tomorrow to the computer to have them install my Ethernet card. It is not compatible with my laptop. I am right now in the school of business. However, I am really interested in psychology, and am thinking of changing my major. My dad thinks this is a terrible idea. My mom thinks I should do what will make me happy. I guess I need to get as much information as I can about the type of jobs that I can get with a psychology degree and the amount of school I will have to complete. I will also need to see what schools have good psychology departments. I really do not want to go here next year. I want to go somewhere smaller with less freaks. I will probably stay in the state. I will probably go to A&M of Baylor. Oh well, I guess I have a while to decide. "
"I'm pretty happy with my first week and a half of classes. I've met a lot of people. It means a lot to me. I am a very quiet, sort of shy person. I was afraid of coming to UT because I'm not the best at making friends. So far though, it hasn't been a problem. My big classes have been a little intimidating because of there size. I used to have classes about 30 or less. Right now I am happy, UT won its first football game. I'm glad I was able to go. It was lots of fun. Now I feel a little exhausted. I haven't really done all that much today. I actually got to sleep for 12 hours last night. I could be exhausted because I am hungry. I think I'm pretty lucky. My parents sent me some food. My brother brought it to Austin. He and I will share it. I'm already starting to miss home-cooked meals. I think my 20 minutes are just about up. I probably fix a bite to eat, watch a little T. V. and go to sleep. "
"This is the first time I have come to the library and when I first arrived here, I had no idea how to use the computers. First you have to wait in line and get on a waiting list. Then after that you finally get assigned a station to use. I wonder what the point of this assignment is. I think it's just another type of experiment to see what different people are thinking and what affects their thought. How much is someone supposed to write for twenty minutes? People who type fast can take ten minutes and write as much as someone who types slowly and has been writing for twenty minutes. Another feeling I have is that of being worried because I am doing this assignment at the last moment. After finishing it, I hope that I will get to class on time but I should because I still have a couple of hours before class starts. I am not sure what to write now. I have thoughts, but they are personal thoughts so I am not going to write them down. I need to start getting to my morning class on time. I've missed it a couple of times now even though all the material I have learned before but I do still need a review so I have to start trying to get there on time. It's strange typing this assignment because all through high school I always had to worry about grammar, sentence structure, and spelling on writing assignments. It feels like I am writing an e-mail to someone because I never worry about any English stuff on those. The only thing I am doing different is that I am capitalizing some of the words which I normally don't do when I write e-mails. I want this twenty minutes to pass by faster so I can move on to the next assignment. These type of assignments are fun because you can say whatever you want and don't have to worry about anything. I like this class so far. I have always wondered what different people are thinking and what their reactions would be they are in the same situations. Two more minutes and that will be twenty. I can't wait to go back to Houston to visit. I am partially homesick. There are certain things that I want to go back for and other things that I am glad that I left behind. "
"Ok so I just got back from a four hour study hour thing at the ZTA house. WOW the most pointless thing ever. I read maybe 10 pages. How am I supposed to study with 50 other girls there in the room? You don't have that much space and of course you want to talk about what happened last night and who ended up where, and blahblahblah. I know they have good intentions in making us do this, but 4 hours at one time is waaay too long to try to study. No one really got anything done. But hey it was fun- I got to bond more with my sorority sisters! Speaking of sorority stuff, I love it. At first, I was afraid I wouldn't like it, or that the girls wouldn't like me, but I Couldn't be having more fun. I have more friends than I thought I would have going into college, and they're real friends, too, not friends you ""pay for"" with sorority fees. I'm listening to music right now, and recently (as in the past couple of months) I've gotten more and more into music. I've always loved music, but ever since I dated a great guy who is a complete music person I've liked it even more. Today kyle and I (my aggie ex-boyfriend) were joking about how pathetic we are for missing eachother so much. it was funny. we knew going into it at the beginning of the summer that we were going to break up when we went off to college because, of course, it wouldn't work. But now that we're all settled in, we still miss eachother. It got really serious really fast. it was unbelievably random. We never thought we would hook-up, but it happened and it was awesome. I hate to say it because I'm so young and I hate it when people say things like that, but I could quite possibly see myself with him after college- like permanently. That's so weird. Well, sincewe did break up, we are allowed to hang out with other people (date-wise) but neither of us really wanted to. Last week I met this really cool guy from the Woodlands-he's an ATO pledge. I've gone to a couple parties with him as his date and I kind of have a crush on him. It's exciting, but at the same time, I'm far from being over Kyle. The whole point of not being together was that we could go out and have fun without being tied down, but I still feel bad about it. I have constantly had this entire ""soap opera"" on my mind for the last week- nonstop. The cool thing about being in a relationship is that you have that stability- you never have to wonder if he likes you, or if he's going to call and all that. With a new guy it's always like I wonder if he likes me and why didn't he call?-worrying. It's fun, don't' get me wrong, but it kind of puts ur confidence in check. I've recently gotten into Maroon 5 again. I used to love them, but working at Hollister and hearing the entire CD all the time made me hate it. I don't work at Hollister anymore, so I havent heard Maroon 5 in awhile, and now I love them again. "
"Right now I'm feeling relieved that I was able to get here  the last couple of times I tried to get to this site the computer told me the site was unavailable. Very frustrating! I like this assignment, although I'm not sure why 20 minutes are necessary; it seems to me that 10 or even 5 minutes would do. I'm really not sure what to write next  I haven't done this kind of thing since seventh grade, when I was home schooled. It's weird how your mind goes blank sometimes. I still don't know what to write. My thoughts are mostly involved with UT, with classes and so forth. I like them, in general, but only one has been intellectually stimulating so far (no, I am not going to tell you which one!) I have great hopes for the rest, though  sometimes it takes a while for a class to get into gear. Don't know what to write. Don't know what to write. Feeling frustrated, I guess. I was afraid I wouldn't think of anything to write. It's not that I have a sluggish or inactive mind  quite the opposite, actually. It's just that sometimes I don't do well when I have to write it down. Which is strange, because I love to write. I keep a journal (which you, Prof. Pennebaker, would probably find interesting) and enjoy writing in it my gripes, hopes, fears, joys and other important stuff. Maybe I'm just not good at this kind of structured work. I'm lefthanded, Prof. P  does that have anything to do with it? I have a vivid imagination, and am inclined to daydream. Hey I just remembered, you said these were confidential. I can write anything I want! I don't feel any freer with that in mind, however. I'm stuck again. Still stuck. I wonder how many of my fellow classmates have the same trouble I do with this. Stuck. Now I'm thinking of the guy I like. (I'm not going to give his name, because I'm serious about him, and I'm not sure just exactly how confidential this really is. ) I wonder if you actually read any of these, just to see what kind of people are in your class. I know that if you really picked my brain you'd have some interesting stuff (interesting in a good way, of course!) This is a tumultuous and crazy time in my life, although most people would think it tame. My beliefs are undergoing an overhaul, and everything seems to be up in the air. That's not a good feeling, but it's never dull! I think in the last few months I've learned a lot about prejudice and tolerance, and I'm glad I'm learning what I am, even if it destroys my plans for perfect happiness (sarcasm there). What kind of a world is it where people who search for truth risk having everything they want taken away? This can't be right. But it's true, and there's no denying it. This makes me feel apprehensive and sad. I feel some anger at the world, and at God too. (Yes, Prof. Pennebaker, I believe there is a God!) But real religion requires immense amounts of faith, and I have to trust that everything will end up ok. Now I feel slightly reassured. If only everything weren't so uncertain! But do I really want a world where you know exactly what's going to happen next? What if you knew when bad things were going to happen, but were powerless to prevent any of them, because everything was predestined? It's possible that everything IS predestined, but that we don't know about it. Maybe you don't admit that as a possibility, Prof. P, but I do. Anyhow, I would much rather not know what's going to happen next in most cases. But in some, like who I'm going to marry, I can barely contain my curiosity. I guess that's due to a lack of satisfying relationships in my life, that I so strongly feel the need for another one. But whatever happens, I refuse to worry  if everything's predestined, I can't change it anyway, and if it is, then I can still change things for the better. "
"There are so many things on my mind today. I am still trying to get the hang of college life and trying to cope with the new change. Everything here at UT is so different. College is different. It is not what I expected it to be or even what I had imagined. Do not get me wrong, I love UT, it is just that I am use to the High school ways. You know, the whole part of being spoon fed. Here I have to be responsible, be an adult, make my own decisions, and I am just not ready for that quite yet. UT is so huge and diverse. There are so many people and organizations. Right now I feel overwhelmed and a little out of place. I guess it is because I am a Freshman, but I know that I will get over it soon. I have been missing my family, friends, and boyfriend so much today. You see I have never really been away from home for more than a week, so this is really new to me. It is an experience. One that I know is going to change my life forever. All night I have been thinking of everything and how new all of it is, and it has made me a little scared and nervous. I have even felt a little stressed out about it. And now I have this thought in my head that I won't make it here at UT. But I know that it is just a thought and that all I have to do is adapt to this new change and work my hardest to make it be successful. I have four years here at UT. I plan to make them the best. Besides, I have always loved this school. Ever since I was a little girl this has been my dream school. And now that I am here I am going to make the best of it. I have the pride. I have the spirit. All I need to do is believe in myself and do my very best. UT is the best and I am very glad that I chose to come here. So in all, I guess the way I am feeling is pretty normal for a Freshman. I just need to get the hang of things and everything will be alright. Hook 'em Horns. "
"I have at least forty- thousand different things I have to do and about forty thousand different things going on around me  For one, my parents are out of the country, so it makes everything that much more complicated  second, I have been so busy with my sorority pledge class that I haven't really had time to do homework. just for the record, I feel completely overwhelmed right now. anyway, I went home this weekend just for one night and although it was extremely relaxing, it turned out that it was completely pointless to go because almost my entire family is out of the country. so I go anyway and have a great time just relaxing in my empty house with my dog and the tv, but I forget to bring back with me all my toiletries and makeup  luckily enough for me one of my best friends also went home this weekend and is coming back today, so I had to arrange with her a plan to get my stuff before she leaves that was a total fiasco because as I said before my parents are out of town and the only person who has a key is my aunt but Becky, my friend, doesn't have a car so its just been crazy like that  so I get everything figured out with her but meanwhile my cousin who was house-sitting my house decided to come up to austin so I gave him list of things to bring from home, but we can never find a time when both of us are free so I still haven't gotten my much needed chemistry and calculus notes from high school (or my sunglasses)  its not that big of a deal its just that I really truly need this stuff and the fact that he was so close to my dorm and we never ended seeing each other. oh well I guess he can FedEx the stuff up to me  that way I'll get a package, that is really cool since I don't get any mail anymore. oh and I haven't even mentioned the fact that my computer just does not want to work. no matter how many people play around with it, it still wont work right now I'm using my roommates computer which I have to say is a lot easier to use than mine  I've had a total of I think 4 different guys in to look at my computer, two professional and two of my friends and no one can fix it. the last professional guy is sending someone else tomorrow to look at it because he's ""really good""  at fixing this sort of problem  also he has better tools for the job. its getting really expensive to keep paying these guys to not change my computer  oh well I guess this counts as one of life's unexpected expenses  my parents always warned me about these unexpected incidents that cost a lot of money and I guess they prepared me for it I guess that's why I don't like to spend my own money by writing checks instead I prefer just to charge it to my parents I just wish they wouldn't get mad about it now I'm totally kidding  I have a monthly allowance now and I'm not used to it yet it takes time to adjust right?  overall, I am enjoying college I just have a lot on my mind and a lot to do not that that was any different in high school I was really involved in different organizations and I was in all AP classes so I did get stressed quite easily  I've been meeting a lot of new people of whom I love so far and staying friends with all of my best friends all of my friends live in my dorm so I'm really lucky to be able to experience college with them   "
"I have so many things to do and not enough time. I feel like I am taking on too much. I know I can handle it if I get past these first few weeks, but right now I feel overwhlemed. I am stressed out with all the reading I have to do. I am such a slow reader and it takes so much effort for me to concentrate and take notes. I know though that I am a good notetaker and if I take the time I should do well in my classes. I am just too tired and stressed right now. I wish I could be at home where no one would come in to bug me or try to use my things and my computer. I am so frustrated with my roommates using my computer. It is new and I am worried they will mess something up. If I make it through till next Tuesday I will be ok. This weekend will be fun though so I just need to relax for once and enjoy it. I miss my family when I get stressed out like this. I keep telling myself""If I can only make it till December. "" It is not that I dislike UT. I like my schedule and my professors, but it is just so different. I know this will be one of my hardest semesters, so with God's help, I will make it through just fine. I just need to relax and enjoy it. I am so determined to make a very good GPA this semseter that I hope I am not dissapointed. The scholarship requirements are good because it gives me a reason to work for them. Actually, I think it scares me more than it helps. I want to make good grades for myself. The scholarship makes me afraid of failure. I am such aperfectionist that I hate failure. I am determined to make a good GPA within my 15 hours. I want to prove everyone wrong who tells me I should have taken 12. If I took 12 I would be in summer school forever. I know I can handle it because I did so much in high school that I am prepared forit. I also don't care if people make fun of me for studying too much. It will payoff when they do bad this semester. I think I just need a break. I am caught up in my reading, but I need a week without 10 different activities for me to do. I just have to have confidence in myself that I can do it and things will get easier as the semester goes on. I felt so good though last night when I got 2 dates. Maybe I will meet some great guy while up here. I was beginning to have my doubts. I am excited about football season beginning. It should be fun to see all the college games. I love college football. I hope we do well this year. I feel like I am running out of things to babble about. Or that all I have done it repeat myself over and over. I guess it doesn't matter as long as I write what I am feeling. All I  hope is that I get everything finished early so that I can go to sleep early tonight. I think I will be able to do that. Well, maybe tomarrow will be a better day. I can't wait till there is nothing going on that I have to go out for. I am sure next week will be better. "
"ok, right now I feel tired and annoyed. maybe because I just broke up with my boyfriend of 10 months but maybe its because I couldnt get this website to work forever or the fact that I went to bed at two for no reason. putting the tired aside, I'm also pretty exited. my brother is teaching me how to solve a rubiks cube. I love doing things like that, but sometimes I give up too easily. not now though, I can't. not about the rubiks cube, but about the business school that everyone I talk to feels the need to tell me how difficult it is to get in,  but I'm not giving up. I'm trying to adjust to austin and its really not that hard, I just don't want to call it my home because its not- I've lived in houston my entire life. that's my home. even though I was raised in houston, ill end up in colorado. I feel like I'm trying to make conversation to a comuter which doesn't really work so ill just tell you about me. I love the color blue-any shade of blue, I love them all. I love cold weather even though I don't know what its like to be in a snow storm or shovel snow to get out of the driveway. I want a big truck when I'm old-not to show off but to be comfortable. I want to work, not be a housewife even though I do want kids maybe two or three. I admire my mom. she struggles and I love her. I was raised mormon even though I am not mormon anymore. I love dave matthews and sarah maclaclan  thier perceptions of life are awesome  I love songs that hit me right in the heart whether its an uplifting song or not. I love writing even though it takes me forever to write something worth reading. I like kissing. only when its sweet and meaningful for him and me. I love being a friend. helping those that I care about-it just makes me tingle inside. even though I wasnt always like that. I used to have the best scream. I was a selfish kid. I threw fits. I'm better, now I like to share. I didnot smile until I was two. sometimes I worry I have a bad heart because I can randomly have my heart go wild (literaly)  I wonder sometimes too if I got my moms manic depression. I'm not a sad person overall but I can be a lot. I always wondered how that worked too. maybe this course will help me understand. I like beer, but not too much. I used to drink to get my mind of things, now I realize that was dumb. now I write to get it off my chest. what do I think about?  god. the world. people. why?  I don't stand up to my dad even though my front pretends I do. I really just avoid him. his wife is evil, but her kids are the best. how do things like that work out? I have four brothers and a sister. I love them all. they are all so interesting and so individualistic. I have an ex boyfriend named ben that I am obsessed with and so does my roomate, mary. we both wore the same prom dress and bought the same bedding even though we did not shop together. I want her dad to mary my mom  hes neat. he writes for the houston chronicle and my mom is an english teacher. even though it wasnt her choice. she had to start working to be financially stable to avoid my dad. that s why I'm determined to make it in the business school and not be a housewife and drive a big truck. "
"Today I went to class at 8AM. I didn't want to get up at all. Even though I slept by 11PM, it was really hard to wake up this morning. I do not look forward towards Tuesdays and Thursdays. My first class today at 8AM was all the way across campus and it made the walk there more dreadful. Also, when I got up there I didn't learn a bit. You know how in Charlie Brown the teacher talks like wah wah wahhh wah wah. "", the teacher's aid voice just seemed to trail away. As the class neared the end, I left early so that I could go home and catch a couple of z's before my next class which was at 11AM. Soon as I got home, I just fell asleep almost instantaneously. For some odd reason, I had a dream of home. Maybe I do miss it more than I think. By 10:30AM, I woke up to get myself prepared for the next class. I left late and arrived to class late, leaving me to sitting on the floor next to the door. Taking notes is such a pain in the ass, when trying to use your legs as a desk. I just sat there thinking about the repetitive information. Then soon after the 2nd or 3rd example, I blanked out and started to think about what I should do when I get home (back to my dorm) and that I needed to study for a quiz the next class. After the very monotonous class was over, I head towards my dorm room to eat some lunch with my roommate. I think he is feeling the same way as I do, tired, hungry, nostalgic, and lethargic. After lunch, I got prepared for my quiz. I ended up studying for 10 minutes at most. I should have studied more but I wasn't up to it. After studying a little, I watched the news and then headed for a class. I also went to that class a little late. For some reason, today has just been an ""off"" day. I think I did rather well on that quiz and the information didn't seem like it was ""out of this world. ""                 I guess the best way to track my feelings/ thoughts for this 20 minutes is the way I felt and thought about my day. I feel like this day was pointless in some way and that I should have done something productive. It seems like I always feel like that. The only thing I've achieved today was canceling my friend's plane ticket from Northwest Arkansas to Austin. She was coming to watch the old rivals play. I cancelled the airplane ticket because she found a cheaper mode of transportation. Other than that I set up my new computer and caught up with the news in Iraq and in California and also the hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. I think I need to be motivated more. Someone to tell me that I need to go do something or someone to go do something with. I guess it's because I am feeling nostalgia. Back at home, I usually had someone to go do something with me or ask me to do something or whatever. But in this new setting and the freedom, I haven't done too much. Maybe I am doing more than the usual because I've finished most of my homework and chores this weekend and I'm just thinking that I need to do more. I guess it'll take me a while to get use to the college life. "
"I can't believe she did that. She is supposed to be my suitemate, and my friend. She knows that I like him, and I thought I could trust her with my secret thoughts on him. Why did she have to run off and tell him everything I've said in the past 3 weeks? What kind of friend is that? Did she think she was helping the situation? The question that I've been asking myself for the past few days is, how do you know when you can trust someone?        Why can't people mind their own business? In all of my years so far, growing up with gossiping girls hasn't always been easy, but I always knew how to keep a secret. If someone can't trust you with their secret, how do you expect to trust them with yours? There was this old saying my friends and I used to repeat in junior high, Secrets secrets are no fun, secrets are for everyone. Secrets secrets are no fun, unless you let me in on one!"" How true is that? I wish I could just take back everything I have said to her, knowing that she has run her mouth to the last person that needs to know my secrets. I can feel the tension between us building up slowly. When she asks me a question, I can hold back my answers because I still have some resentment towards her. Sometimes I even forget that I am supposed to be mad at her, and to make things worse, she doesn't know that I am mad at her. Mad isn't the correct word to describe my feelings; disappointed makes more sense. I met her through a mutual friend 2 years ago at a concert in Houston. I thought that would be the last time I would ever see her, and those 15 minutes of conversation with her are blurred now. When our mutual friend informed me that she was attending the same school as me, and living in the same dorm as me, I thought that we should be suitemates and try living together. At first, we hit it off surprisingly well, doing everything together. It was like we had been best friends since elementary school! We are even rushing the same sorority. Can anyone tell me they have been in my difficult situation before? Well if you have, please write a manual for me to read on how to deal with lying suitemates/friends that you thought you could trust. What bothers me the most is that she doesn't know that I know what she is been doing behind my back. Everytime I would make a comment about the guy I'm into, or hang out with him and come back to my room glowing, we would sit down and talk and gossip about it. Why didn't I see it coming? Why couldn't I have known that she would betray my trust and run along and tell that guy everything I have been gushing about? It doesn't make any sense to me, because I have higher expectations in a friend than that. I expect a friend to respect my secrets, my wishes, and my personal life that doesn't involve them. I guess it's partly my fault for not watching what I say around her, like talking about things that I wouldn't want to get back to him. I guess it's partly my fault also, for trusting in her too fast. My roommate has been very supportive of the whole thing. She told me to just watch what I say around her, and to not say anything that I wouldn't want ANYONE else to know. It just hurts my feelings that she would gain my trust and then knock it down quick to the start. Maybe I shouldn't be so open with people I barely know. Maybe I shouldn't feel guilty, because ultimately it was her screw-up. Right? "
"I am happy that I made the transition from Georgia Tech to UT. I am cautious about my future and what I want to get involved in. I want to become a Texas Wrangler but I am unsure that they will take me. I want to do well in school and get in to law school. I don't study as much as I want to, and I need to work on that. I love sports and I like football most of all. I wish I had played football was a kid. I am excited about the future of our country and I want to get involved. I don't understand what this assignment is about, but I will write everything that is on my mind. I worry a lot about stuff that is of no concern to me. I try to be the best student and person that I can be. I have a lot of pressure on me from my past and the way I have been raised. I've always been a good student and pretty athletic, and I try to be the best at everything. I knew that is bad, but I feel that that is the way I was born. I believe our President is guilty and should be impeached for the good of the nation. He is a smart man, but he is personally corrupt. I have a roommate that is good. He is Norwegian and is a great student. He is fun to hang out with and we get along well. I have a girlfriend and I'm not sure if we should stay together. We get along well, but I feel like I have the whole world at my fingertips, and she is holding me down. ,  WE share a lot together and we are best friends, but she wants more. more time, more money. etc. My parents are strong Christians, but ?I am not sure that that is what I want. College is a time to figure all of this out, and I am glad I am here. It is a fun place and the knowledge here is overwhelming. I am like a sponge trying to get it all in my head. I want to be an attorney and I feel like al the knowledge will make me a better lawyer. I want to be the best that I can be and make a good future for myself. My Mom never went to college so she wants me to make the most of it. It is a lot of pressure from her, and I try to be a role model for my younger brother. He is a trouble maker, and I want to be a positive influence in his life. He is a good kid, but the friends he is with are not good for him. I love my family very much. I can't wait for the UT UCLA football game. I love the game and I love the school spirit it provides. I was an engineering major at Georgia Tech last year and I made the switch to UT all by myself. I am proud of that move, and I wouldn't have it any other way. It was the best move I've ever made. I like the big school here and the number of students here. I want to run for public office when I get older and make this country a better place. I feel like I can be a good leader and bring good things to this country. I am a good person, and I believe others will think so too.  "
"""antisocial""--that is what it said in large letters as I walked into my dorm room today. Everyone on my floor thinks I am antisocial. I hate the way that people do not ever understand the difference between anitsocial and shy. I wish that people would just to understand people more and hate them less. I guess it is partially my fault. I long to meet new people and make new friends but I spend all of my time locked in my room talking to all of my old freinds that are hundrends of miles away. They are all coming to visit me tomorrow for my 19th birthday. lots of them are coming. I guess it will at least show all of the jerks on my floor that I am not as ""anitsocial"" as they think I am. They are all so stupid anyway. All they do is get drunk every single night. How can they think so highly of themselves living that way. When do they ever study? The true is that I am jealous of them, I have always wanted to be so carefree and fun. But, I would never pick on anyone, EVER! I guess I could go out and party everynight, but that just isn't me. I would fell silly if I ever went to one of those wild parties. Besides, I am going to be a doctor, I need to stay and study. It makes me sick to imagine the possibility of not getting into medical school, it is my dream, the only thing I really want. But, I am not the most desipined student, I love to slack off and sit and play on aol. I will never get into a good medical school and then I will be lost, it is the scariest thing I have ever had to face. It is so scary that I try to protect myself. I am a diehard romantic and it is amazing that in my lowest moments I think about marrying Ty in order to secure my future. Ty is my ex-boyfreind that I would never be happy with but I in the business honors program and wil surely be rich someday. I often think that if I marry him then it will be okay if my medical school falls through. I know it would be stupid but I think it at times. What I really want is someone to sweep me off my feet, like in the movies. I love okd black and white mushy romantic movies more than anything in the world. The are so sweet and beautiful and you can always tell that they will never fall out of love and that they really will live happily ever after. Such a nice thought. I guess I cna't ask for a fairy tale but I know that I will never get a divorce. NEVER!  I was always so proud growing up that my parents never divorced. I always thought that it somehow made me better than everyone, like I had something to do with it. Well, the last day of school on my Sophmore year my mom called me into the living room and told me she was moving out. I thought I was going to die. The effects of this event have been bothering me ever since. I am so clingy now with guys I date that I drive them insane. I have this unbelievable fear of being left by those I love, and I wwent through a phase were I cried everyday for a year. I am going to be a much better parent to my kids than most. I am going to sing to them and show them hapy movies and take them to museums and plays and play games with them. I will puch them to be wonderful, but not too much. And I will make sure that every moment of their lives they know how much I love them. I can't wait to have children. I do worry thought. sometimes even the best parents can't always innfluence their kids to be good. Tonight Ty is taking me out for dinner. I invited my roommate to come with us, she said she would and I feel bad because I think it hurt his feelings that I asked her. I just can't help it. Even in high school I would invite the band director that everyody hated to walk around with us in Disney World. He looked so lonely walking by himself. I hope I find someone to appricate me being like that. "
"     this is the weirdest thing I have ever had to-do. right now my roommate is watching the graham Norton effect and it is hard to concentrate. the show is really funny. he just changed the channel I am going to ask if could turn it down a little. Yesterday I had a really good date. it is all I can think about today. I hope things turn out good because I don't want to be hurt. I went to the gym today. I like and dislike working out. I like the end result and the feeling after working out, but I hate the feeling before I have start working out. I want to go out tonight. I don't have class on Fridays so I feel obligated to go out and do something. I got some people to go salsa dancing. nobody has really confirmed f they're going or not. I kind don't want to go anymore, but since some people already said yes I have to go. I am sure I will have tonight. this is really strange. I am just spilling out random thoughts. I really like the guy I went on date with. Well I don't know if I like him or if I like the idea of being with him? I guess time will show. I am tired of being single. I want a boyfriend! I was at the gym and I felt for some reason really aroused. I usually don't get aroused at the gym but today I saw a really hot guy that I couldn't get out of my head. I wonder if that is  BAD THING to like a guy but still be really turned on by other guys. I know it is perfectly normal but I would have tired something with this guy if he had asked me to. maybe that's why people think I am whore. I m really sexual. I am really worried about getting in the communication school. I think about everyday. if I don't get in I don't know what I will do if I don't get in. I just had dinner by myself. I hate eating by myself. I think it is because I had no friends when I was growing up. I have friends now but tend to want them around to much. I want to have sex I hope ya'll don't read this because are going to think the worst of me, but at the same time I don't what anybody thinks of me. for the most part. I keep looking at the clock to see how much time I have left. I hope I am doing this right because if I am not than I will be really mad. my is cool but he tends to be an ass sometimes. he was just over my shoulder reading this. I told him not too and then he stop. he is watching Seinfeld now I wish I could enjoy the show right now. Wait no he is watching the king of queens. my mistake. I can concentrate now because I don't like that show. I have a lot of pretty friends. "
"Today, what am I feeling. actually my roommate and I were talking about how we werer homesick. not in a bad way. we just miss home. I wish I knew what it was about home that I miss. is it the people? no not really considering I didn't have any really good friends when I left home. it it my parents? yeah some of it is that. but there's just this emptiness and I can't figure it out. I also feel like I am in a hella bad mood. it could be pms but it think it is a little too early. I really really hate pms. I get totally irritable and I was noticing yesterday how I felt really annoyed with people. especially my roomate and another friend. I figured it was just cause I was tired and sick of people in general but now I think maybe it is something more. well the stress of school finally begins. I'm remembering how much I hate stress. this stress is alittle different because its mixed with a lot of anxiety. I am a very anxious person at times and I hate it. I get very freaked out when I don't know what is going to happen. I guess you could say I have a big fear of the unknown. when I was applying to high school I used to freak out a lot and have crying fits because I didn't know where I was going to school. then this spring I would have freak out attacks about where I would live. I hate not knowing what will happen in the future. I think its kinda funny that I am a christian yet I struggle with the unknown. part of being a christian is having faith in god to work out all the things he has for you. but I find it really hard to trust in god and just let the fear go. I guess I have my weak areas just like all christians. anyways anxiety, I am really anxious about school. I have no idea what to expect as far as tests and grades. I told myself that because I couldnt drink this semester I would try really hard to get good grades. but it is just so hard to make myself sit down and study. I am areally lazy person and I don't like to work very hard if I don't' have to. I'm starting to ahve doubts about my major. I reaaly love spanish but I'm not sure I'm good enough to pursue it as a major. I guess there are just a lot of people in my spanish class who seem to be  so much better that I am at spanish and I get discouraged. anyways, I think my friend graham made a good point when he said that a lot of people didn't place out of spanish hours like I did and that college spanish teaches you a lot morethan high school spanish. I think he was right. but still, I'm just not real sure any more. ugh the people next door play their music so loud. it really is rude. I wonder if we play our music too loud nad jus tdon;t realize it. hmmmm. well time feels like its going by really slowly. perhaps my bad mood is jus t the devil trying to take away from the awesome things god did this weekend. well that's a thought. that retreat kicked some booty!!!!!! "
"It is 12:53 on Tuesday and my roommate and I just finished eating lunch and  came down to the computer lab to work on our assignment. My computer in our  room is not hooked up to the Internet yet, so for the time being I have to come  down here. That's ok. The guy just came over because we forgot to give him our  IDs. Oops. Oh well. Anyway, I'm really sad lately. I miss all my friends from high school. Everyone I've met so far has been really nice and everything; I just miss how close we all were last year. I could go anywhere, to any school function, and see people that I knew and would feel comfortable with. Here, it's not that there are so many people - it's just that there are so many  people that I don't know. Every face that I pass on campus is another stranger. Actually, I have seen a few people that I know from other places. Earlier today I saw Brittany. But it's just not the same as walking down the hall and knowing every single person. I was so comfortable there. I don't know. I should  probably be writing on the other assignment topic, since I'm going off about  high school and college and what have you, but I'm kind of just blabbering so  whatever. I am ready to be comfortable with lots of people again. I miss my comfort zone that I had at Anderson and I want it back!!   Hey!  I just looked at my watch and it has already been ten minutes. I guess I  can't really say that it's been ten minutes, because of that guy that came over. It's probably been more like seven minutes. I don't like this keyboard. It's kind of hard to type on. This assignment is actually harder than I thought it  would be. I mean, it's not hard, because I'm not really writing on anything in particular, but it is kind of hard to think continuously for twenty minutes. I think it's crazy that so many Anderson people are in my psychology class. It  also freaks me out that Alex is in our class. Since you don't know about Alex, just let me say that he is the most intimidating person in the world. I think  underneath that tough guy Russian thing he has going for him he's really  probably a very nice person, but I don't know how easy it is for me to look past  the fact that he actually chased someone with an axe on the last day of school our junior year at City Park. So I wouldn't fail Alex if I were you. He might come to your office with his axe (do you spell it ""axe"" or ""ax""?  I don't know) or his machete or any of his other assortment of weapons that he totes around with him. I would really like to get to know him though - I think he would be an interesting person to get under his skin and see what he's really like. Not to mention the fact that it would be cool to have him be your friend in case someone was giving you trouble. I think that time is probably almost up, but I would kind of like to keep  writing. I think I will. The temperature in this room is perfectly comfortable. I don't know where that thought came from. I am scared about having to write papers. What if my professors don't like the way I write?  I've always loved to write, but I like writing creatively. I'm pretty bad at comparing and  contrasting and all my research papers are boring. I mean I got good grades on  them, but later I'd go back and read them and be like ""Hey did I actually write this?  Yuck. ""  I think I'm probably being hard on myself. I wonder how many  times I have used the word probably in this assignment so far. I bet a lot. I hate when people don't know that a lot is two words and not one. I wonder what Angie's deal is. She used to be so nice, but ever since Dis and  I rushed she has been so rude. That's her problem, I know. And it kind of  always justifies the fact that I didn't like her that much. I always had to  act like I did, and she was nice enough, but just something about her has  always rubbed me the wrong way. That's what I told Brian. Brian -- what to do about Brian?  I wish I knew I wish I could have some answer. I hate  leading  him on the way I did the other night, but that just seemed unavoidable. I know he needs me  and that's what I love about him. When I'm around him I feel  special and needed and important. But I just don't know if that is enough. "
"What is Ale doing right now? She looks pretty funny ironing on a table. Wow! I have a lot of homework and I don't even get some of it. I need to get a tutor for like every subject. It's Monday, shit! I still need 4 more days till the weekend. I wonder if Rodrigo is going to call me for the weekend. I hope this weekend is way better than last weekend. Eww! It smells like burnt clothes hahaha. I don't want to go to class right now. I still need to wash my clothes. Where am I going to get change? I don't want to walk anywhere. I need to call my mom for some more money. Oh! my dad too. Oh God I just signed up for a Friday night experiment! I hope it doesn't interfere with my Friday night. Oh wow! I got fat over a couple of months. That's it I'm on a diet. Damn, it's only been Five minutes. Hmmmmm, can I even put foul language on this assignment? Will he even read this. God! I hate eminem reminds me of the ugly winters in Laredo. I don't miss Laredo. Whoa! Ale looks like a maid ironing! hahaha. Why hasn't Rodrigo called me? I wonder if he still loves me. Should he trust me and I trust him? God, 7 minutes barely. I wonder if he is going to check for spelling or punctuation. Ummm. I'm pretty hungry, but I'm on a diet. Where is Anne? She is never here. I need to go exercise after I go to class and after I wash my clothes. I smell starch. I need some water. I think I'm getting dehydrated. I need to buy that necklace that I liked in BeBe. It'll look great with my new outfit. I need to get a guy. I'm tired of being a tag a long. I want a nice latin guy with money. I have to admit that does attract me. In fact, it'll attract any girl. Oooh I like this song, is there any more room for me, in those jeans""! Ale thinks I'm bad, but I'm not I just like to express myself. I like myself, I would date me. Why doesn't anyone want me or Ale? I guess, we are not girlfriend material. How can you get to be ""girlfriend material"". Okay. I am spilling too much information for my professor. Will he think I'm weird! I am weird sometimes. My book just fell! My phone is ringing and I can't pick it up. Awww. The newspaper just fell. Ale is making a mess and she can't iron for shit. I should stop saying bad words. It doesn't look nice on a lady like me. Ale's making me hot with the iron. I wonder if she will iron my clothes. Oh Wow! I have about a min. actually. Wow! this song is so ghetto, but I can feel my head bouncing. "
"Wrecks. They are the worst things ever. I can't believe princess Diana died  yesterday. It shows that anyone can die at any moment. Of all people, a  princess, a mother, an internationally known woman, a philanthropical figure  in this world. It's sad. Yesterday I was running down the street to pick up  an anklet for a friend and I saw a wreck happen. it is scary. luckily no one  was hurt but it could've been alot worse. The anklet was awesome though. I  kind of wish that the one I bought was like hers but thats okay because I got  an even better one later on in the day. I had to sit for almost an hour to  wait for the police to come because I witnessed that stupid wreck. and then  they didn't show so I just gave the girl my name and phone number and then I  left. I have better things to do, like eat. The food here really isn't that  bad. I haven't been eating from much of a variety though. Everyday I eat  from a choice of about four meals. I can live like that though. My roommate  is really starting to bother me. I should have known this would happen , but  everyone always thinks ""that will never happen to me"". Just like getting in  a car wreck, getting pregnant, or getting a disease like aids or something. I hope I never get any of those things. I don't know what I would do. I'd  feel like such a failure. It does happen to so many people though. And  everyone deals with it in a different way. to each his own. And everything is  just fine to me just now. no need for me to change my life,  I have my friends , my boy, my studies, my sorority, and my own life here in college. Being away  from the parents is such an amazing feeling. just the fact that we are proving  to ourselves that we can do it on our own. feed ourselves, discipline  ourselves, control ourselves, wash our laundry and all that stuff. Im doing  okay. but I know for a fact that not everyone has been handling themselves as  well as I have. I am me and I am okay. "
"Well, I suppose since this is a stream of consciousness exercise I will just say whatever is on my mind, which at the moment happens to be how incredibly horrible this past weekend was. But, let's back up and get the basics down. For graduation, my grandparents promised to buy me a new computer. New, being the operative word. So they told me to go find one that I liked and tell them where it was. My mother and I went out and looked at computers and found a nice setup that included a printer for about $1500. We thought that sounded reasonable, so we informed my grandparents of the computer's location and they said it sounded good. HOWEVER, they went to see my Uncle's family in Dallas for my cousin's birthday and decided to go a cheaper route and not buy a namebrand computer. So I ended up with this piece of crap that keeps shutting down on me. My Dad has been freaking out for the past two weeks how he knew all along we should have gotten a different computer in the first place and how my grandparents always go the cheaper route even when it means less quality and now my entire college career is jeopardized because I cannot get online. So I spent Saturday messing with my computer, trying to reinstall stuff to see if it was a software problem. It wasn't. My Uncle drove in from Dallas on Sunday and took Windows off, reinstalled it, deleted my C drive (which is a big deal), then created a new one and repartitioned it, Everything SEEMED to work for a brief period of time before my computer decided to do one more mad little dance of irony and shut itself down. Now I am stuck with a computer that doesn't even partially compute and my Dad has to come pick it up to take it to some store called ""Computer Doctor"" and meanwhile he's still ranting about how he was right all along and my Mother should talk my grandparents into getting me a new computer, and if they don't how my parents should because if they don't I'm going to flunk because after all everything is online nowadays, etc. So I wasted my weekend sitting up in my room with my family when I could have been in the music room practicing. And I'm a music major, not computer science, so the music building is where I should be. But my mother wouldn't let me go to the music building because she wanted me to be around while they were messing with my computer. So I didn't practice AT ALL this weekend when my professor says I should practice 4 hours a day at least, and I just got a bunch of new music and now I'm totally screwed for my lesson on Friday. I also am having trouble in my music theory class because my teacher never bothered to tell me what an augmented interval or a diminished interval is, and they expect us to learn this stuff in one night, and since we have the class everyday, it's not like we can procrastinate at all. It's very frustrating. or maybe it's just me. I don't know. All I know is that I haven't even typed for ten minutes yet and I'm still complaining. It's not like I usually procrastinate about anything anyway. I mean, I was valedictorian of my high school, I think I know something about time management. Although, being valedictorian of my school was no terrible feat. I went to all the parties and pulled all the typical high school stunts, and had the highest number of ""unexcused absences"" you could have without being held back. And I wrote my speech at three in the morning the day of graduation. So I guess I know a little about procrastination anyway. But I had a reason for waiting that long really! When it was certain that I was going to be valedictorian, everybody started giving me tips, like they knew what they were talking about. ""Don't make it too long, I'll pay you five dollars to say my name, don't make it too boring. I don't want to sit through some damn boring speech. "" Even friends' parents were giving me tips. Everybody wanted to know what I was going to say, so I just didn't even try to come up with anything until the last minute, so I wouldn't have anything to tell them. Most people like me speech I guess. I worked in a favorite quote of mine by Theodore Roosevelt about how the real cowards are the ones who never try. It's a really encouraging quote, and I always used to repeat it to myself when I went to violin auditions because I am an extremely nervous performer. I also used to repeat that thing from Dune by Frank Herbert that the main character Paul used to say ""I will not fear. Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. "" etc, etc. It always sort of helped me get a grip on myself I guess which I need because I'm a very insecure person. And I'm sure that my typing is annoying my roommate right now because I have to use her computer and she's trying to sleep and her computer is right by where her head is on her bed. It's only 12:34 though, and she always goes to sleep around midnight which I think is weird. But then I'm an insomniac and I can never sleep anyway, so I'm usually up until about three. I also am a coffee addict. have been since the age of seven. I think it usually surprises people that I've been drinking coffee so long, but my Dad used to drink at least a pot a day, to that was a drink that was always available. You'd think it would have stunted my growth, but I'm 5'7"". Then again, my brother is only 15 and he's 5'9"", so maybe I would have been taller. Maybe not. I sort of like my height. Hmm, I've got two minutes to go, and I lost my train of thought, so I guess I'll just keep typing until something comes to me. Oh, I'm listening to the soundtrack from ""Schindler's List"" right now. I totally love that movie and the music makes me cry. Music always makes me emotional, but this cd is played by Itzhak Perlman whom I personally feel is the greatest violinist in the world, although Joshua Bell, who did the soundtrack for the ""Red Violin"" is also really good, but younger so he doesn't have as much experience. I'm sure he will be so much better when he's older though. Well, it's been twenty minutes. It was interesting. a little personal odyssey of the mind there. Bye! "
"well here I am in the same predicament. it's interesting how life tends to repeat itself so much. I don't like hearing music while I work. it get's annoying. but allanis morisette is okay. at least she puts some intelligence in her music. but music is distracting. I have a hard enough time sorting out all of the conflicting thoughts and emotions in my head as it is. I don't need music in there screwing things up while I'm trying to work. some people like listening to music while they work. perhaps they just don't have as much running through their minds as I do. I keep thinking of a million things all at once -- a million things that I neeed or want or should do. but will I ever get to them?  sometimes I think I will never be bored. I would love that sensation. to be bored. to think, ""hey, I have nothing better to be doing right now than just sitting around. ""  that would be so wonderful. but perhaps it is impossible for me. perhaps I will always find something to do. there is never going to be a time that I am devoid of all interest, all motivation, all desire to do SOMETHING that my mind tells me should be done. even if I had no school work, even if I finally unpacked all the crap in my room left over from the move. even if there was no one left to email, write, or call. even if all that happened, which it never will, then I'd need to finally get started on one of my many self-initiated ""projects. ""  to learn more about religion -- especially mine. to teach myself how to play the piano, and the guitar, and the violin. to understand women. ha. I'd never finish that project. so perhaps my life consists of perpetual preoccupation. this is a stream of consciousness. I'm supposed to transcribe the thoughts as they run through my head. how is that possible?  that's like trying to describe what happens on each roadway in america all at once. there are too many streamS of consciousness. there isn't just a singular stream. I could talk about the countless thoughts of how busy I am, how stressed my life is right now. I could speak of my love interests, my friends, my relationships with others past and present. I could speak of the things I want in life -- the never ending flow of ""man I want to do that someday""s. I could gripe. I could gripe about anything and everything. I could turn philosophical. I could question. I could write my stream of consciousness about me thinking of any one of these things. yet I am thinking of them all at once. so how do I transcribe that?  and then I look at the clock. ten minutes gone by. I have just put into words a small part of ten minutes of my thoughts. it's interesting how I love to write. it's such a peculiarly interesting thing. I wish I had written more as a kid. I wish I had kept a journal. I did for a while. it's amazing to see you misspell simple words, write so stiffly that the page seems like stone. but still, it's you. it's how you were long ago and how you have changed to what you are now. one excerpt of time. what piece of time. on paper. people talk of time machines, yet we all know they are physically impossible. the closest we will ever get is a little journal and the words that describe what the pen felt from the emotions of the heart. but back to time. I can never stay on one subject in my mind for very long. perhaps that's why I find it hard to sit still for long amounts of time and read. I wish I had more time. I wish I could make everyone happy. I think I could if I had the time. I'm trying to finish my reading. but my friend wants to go out. hell, it's 11:30 at night, and I wanted to get up at a decent time tomorrow. I never get anything done it seems when I start my day at three in the afternoon. but he wants to go out. I guess I should; it's saturday night. but hell, I went out every night this week it seems. why should I go out this night as well just because it's saturday. I should stay and work. I guess it's good though that he asked me to go out and I said yes. if I hadn't of been waiting for him, then I wouldn't have thought right now of the fact that I need to finish this writing assignment.  argh!  I can't stand not to proofread things. I'm such a perfectionist. I had to make sure that word was spelled right. I can't allow myself to not proofread something. even though it seems that's part of the point of this assignment -- to not look back and simply type. that's near impossible for grammar nuts, it's a sin. but I guess I will force myself to hit that submit button in about one minute when my twenty minutes are up. crap!  that sentence ended on a preposition. again, these things just can't happen with my writing. but I will rebel; I will leave it be. I will just accept things for what they are and move on. (another preposition)  perhaps I should act my life out that way. just let things be, accept them as they are, go with the flow, man. maybe if I didn't worry so much things would be much easier. I stopped worrying about the music and it didn't bother me until I thought about it again. I guess I should relax in life. I guess I should go out and have fun and forget about staying in and getting caught up on my work. I guess I shouldn't proofread this. I guess I should just hit that submit button. "
"     let's see. i love him? maybe. he told me he loved me, well, that he liked falling in love with me. wow. this is new. i love being held by him. i miss him when i'm not with him. i think about him when we're not together. i don't know what to tell him. nothing needs to be said though. we like each other. love may come, develop, whatever. it's a good feeling to know that you are loved, not having family and old friends nearby. he makes me feel like i am at home. now that i do have a new home, up in oklahoma. speaking of which, he said he wanted to come with me when i go up. wonder what the parents will say??? oh well, nich likes him and i know they will too. he's hard not to like. so busy, not enough time. should i stay home this weekend to spend more time with him or is that trying too hard? what's trying to hard though, if my feelings are this strong then it shouldn't matter whether or not i try to be with him. obviously he has the same feelings, he only called me every day like five times in the past couple days since he has been busy with his fraternity business. ahh, the good old fraternities. i wish i would have rushed, but then again i am glad i didn't. there is always next year. wonder if it is more difficult to get in as a sophomore?? we shall see. i mean, i don't think greek life is that important. but aparently to some it is. i guess i need to make more friends that are girls. i really do want to become more involved as well. it's just the whole rushing process that i wouldn't like. the getting all dressed up and basically trying to impress some girls. not to mention the fact it seems like competition. one of my not-so-favorite things. i don't really understand it all. i just couldn't be fake like i know some girls are. why bother? i mean, be who you are if they don't like that, then what on earth are you doing? there's no reason for them not to like me. i can't decide whether it's an acceptance thing or not. i don't think i am scared of being rejected. sure in a sense i am. but i think i would take it better if others didn't have to know. i like the perks with a sorority, they seem fun. a lot of time commitment though. i guess i just think that i would see him more often if i were in a sorority, if not that, then i would be just as busy as he is. i mean, i have lots to do now, probably should be doing even more. but still. it's different. poor erik, i wonder if he is still bitter towards his parents about not letting him pledge. it suprised me when my mom said they would pay for it. does she realize the cost? i know she really wants me to get involved as well though. well, i guess i can just ask casey and lauren and other girls how it is. that is if they can say. blah blah blah. nothing on my mind. oh i wonder if lk got the tickets to the live concert. i want to go. but it's such a hassle to drive to katy and back. plus i would probably miss a few classes. let's see, that friday is my homecoming. haha. won't that be great. very unusual for sure, but it will be fun to see everyone. i wonder if they have changed. i know i have. i mean, i haven't seen these people since may. coming here over the summer was one of the most life-changing experiences. strange enough to say, it is very true. i met so many good friends. i met my baby, who. i love. . yeah about that. we've been   together   for sometime now and he is seeming to settle more or less. which i might add, i thought could never happen. ok, but hold on, we're like 18, no settling allowed. yeah he asked if i would marry him. that was funny, jokingly, luckily. haha. no, funny thought to think about though. marriage. ahh. i really can't wait, no can wait, but i look forward (much better wording) to having a family. i want a happy family and a loving father/ husband. wow, i wonder what guys think about this stuff. i never used to even care about family and husband and future stuff. but since he came along and we've been together. it just makes ya think. good thoughts, nothing too serious. man i love him though. i hope he knows. "
"     Okay, I thought right now would be the best time to do this. I'm alone and can think aobut what's going on. These last couple of weeks and been great as in school wise but my personal life has been shitty. We got into a wreck where alcohol was involved and the thing was the driver was designated and had nothing to drink and it was the other guys fault. Somehow with our parents we though we could cover it up aobut the alcohol but they found out aobut everything. This is all that keeps playing over and over right now. Where did we mess up? Well the past is the past and you can't change it. My dad came down and was very disappointed. He didn't know I had been drinknig for 1 and half years now and I don't evne get drunk. I get a buzz and I'm good. I have a few drinks every now and then not even all the time. For some reason he doesn't beleive it. He was furious. He's always trusted me for everything and never thought I'd mess up like this. I do good in school graduated top 2% of my class and everything. I have always done good in school and put school first jsut like my parents taught me too. I never wanted to disappoint my parents. I kept it so none of my little mess-ups would ever reach them. So they would think of me as they saw me everyday. This last senior year I started going to parties and hanging out with different people. I'm a real easy going person. The way I think is that I don't care aobut anything. I let things happen. I make the decisions that I think are right at the time and let whatever happen. I like to make people happy. I'm one of those people that when someone is arguing aobut something I let them argue and win. If they think they are right than they feel good. As for me I don't care. I know I'm right or wrong and I let it be, as lngo as their happy it's all good. So aobut the drinknig I have no idea what lead me to it. I used to be a very shy and not really outgonig person. Everyone liked me but I never tlaked oir anything but people knew me just because I was the only Indian at my school and I was easy gonig and friendly. I hate no one, I think everyone has a good side as long as they don't screw me over. Once someone screws me over than I don't like them but until then I try to get along with everyone. Well I guess that's why I staretd drinkngi to get my shyness away. Very bad excuse, I know. My dad thinks it's peer pressure. Peer pressure has never gotten to me I odn't think. I have a strong will about serious things. If I think it's bad and will do something to me I don't like than I won't do it. I tried weed too because I wanted to know the feeling and after researching that it won't cause damage liek other drugs. I tried smokngi cigars and cigarettes jsut to try it and I have astma so I decdie that wasn't for me. I never did really like the idea aobut smokngi. So so I decdied to stick to drinking because after a couple of times I liked the feeling. It was something different to get awya kind of form reality and really let yourslef go but at the same time still know what your doing. My mind goes from one thing to another right now jsut cause of my dad. My mom doesn't know anything which she would probably cry if she found out and that would make me the guiltiest person ever. I would hate that. My dad I don't know. As I sit here thikngi aobut him I feel more and mroe sorry. He came yesterday and gave me a lecture and I said I wouldn't dirnk anymroe but in a way that didn't sound half-true because I couldn't be sincere I thought it was bullshit. A few drinks every now and then can't hurt. Well I know it can but still it's weird I don't know how to explain. Well he came today again and tried to have anothe rone on one. Me and my dad rarely talk I talk to my mom aobut my problems, so I got angry this afternoon and totally went off when he asked me if I was still going to dirnk and if I had done any other drugs. He doesn't trust me me anymore. That hurts the worst. I'm not a eprson to show my feelings ever because I l;iek to think things thorugh. Right now I feel very guilty. I totally blew my dad off this afternoon and I saw the hurt in his eyes and my dad is rarely a person to show his feelings. I guess I get it from him. It's weird. So now I'mthinkngi aobut how I can make it up. I got a e-mail from one of my ex-best friend that's a gurl. We tried gonig out but it didn't work and then firendship fell thorugh too. But somehow we're still really close even thoguh we don't talk to each other anymore. My dad was discussing me with his best friends who is the girl's father. She said I sohuld stop drinknig and that my dad was really hurt. For some reason I still lsiten ot her so I'm reallyt thikngi abut callnig my dad and saying sorry and sincerely saying that I'm going to stop drinknig. I really do want to stop now. I know I can stop if I put my mind to it. I don't need alcohol anymore. One night can ruin the next 6 years haha. It's crazy "
"right now my mind says why the hell do I have to do this. I'm not up to doing this crap because I just woke up and I realized that I have to get this homework done before it is due in class. I have been missing home and all of my friends. especially the girl I love but she is being a bitch to me sometimes and I don't appreciate that. anyway I have realized that I have been slacking off in my classes and I have to get started on doing all of my homework because if I don't then my ass is going to be back in home racking leaves, and cutting grass. anyway, my roommate, which is my best friend is going to move out on me and I am going to be here all alone. I think that at he is stupid for what he did and I hope that all of it is falsed. he might have gotten his seventeen year old girlfriend pregnant and now she wants him to go home and be with her so he is going to  drop out of college to go back home and take care of her. i sure do hope that the bitch is lying and just wants for him to be close to her for no reason. but if she is lying and doing it on purpose,  then I will fuck the shit out of her for being a bitch. anyway enough of the vulgarity, this is  all that is bothering me and all that is running through my mind, I am also thinking about this girl named felicia that I met last night. she had just turned nineteen and she is one of the nicest girls that I have met down here. she has a wonderfull sense of humor, she doesn't like to leave anyone out and she has a beautifull smile. I don't think that she thinks much about me but I sure do  hope that one of these days she realizes what a great guy I am and she starts to recognize my existance on this earth. tonight is going to be a great night, we are going to go eat chinese food  at the china star, we are also going to go get drunk off our asses and party tonight. my friend is  not going to forget tonight since it will probably be his last night here so I we are going to party for him, the twenty minutes seem to be up so lates and peace out. "
"Well today is my birthday and I am excited. I turn 19. I am no longer just 18 and not quite 21 but somewhere in the middle. Today, I go up at 12:00 in the afternoon. I hate having to wake up so late because my day feels as if it is half gone. I guess that is why I'm here in the computer lab trying to complete these assignments. I am a little disappointed in myself because this assignment was originally due on Friday, but because some people were having difficulty with the computers the deadline was extended to Monday. That is great. I felt awkward because I had not completed the assignment not because I had computer problems but because I was to lazy to do the assignment. I have one problem I think in life and that is that I have too many friends. That seems like a weird thing to say, but it is true. I came to Austin with not one single friend or any family up here and for some reason I have many friends. I ask my friend Jina, do I look like a people-person, because people are just coming up to me and wanting to be my buds. I think that is so great. Most people would usually get very nervous and would not try to continue an conversation with complete strangers, but I try. Once you make the effort to reach put to people you will realize that there is a lot of people wanting to be your friend. I did something in the cafeteria the other day. I was running a way different schedule than my other friends, so I went to the cafeteria alone. I was thinking to myself, great I have to just eat and not talk to anyone. I was not going to do that so I say this guy sitting by himself. He looked decent and it wasn't as if I had any physical attraction to him. I just sneezed right now, two times. No one said bless you. I just thought that was weird. Any was back to my story. I went and sat down with him and we ate dinner together. It turns out that he is from San Antonion also. wow  So I see him every now and then and we say hi to each other. I know this guy, his name is Carlitos. His is the coolest. Everywhere we go he knows someone. He goes to school at SWT but he knows people at UT and UTSA. I want to be someone who has friends everywhere. I have been doing a successful job so far, considering that I'm a freshman. I really like it here at UT. I am making friends, doing reasonably well in my classes, I have an easy job at the MIC in the SSB. To me the SSB is a great building and I talk about it everyone should know but everyone doesn't know about it and I think that is interesting. A building designed to help students and many don't know about it. I understand that the freshman don't know about it but  professors and upperclass students don't know about the SSB. My hands are tired of typing and I have 5 minutes left to write. I like this psy class except that I want to fall asleep in the class. I probably should of scheduled the class for an earlier time. actually I that I think about it I did try but TEX was not working to my favor so I stayed with that time. I hope I get accepted to do the experiments because I surely do not want to do a research project. Tonight we plan on drinking some beer and having some pizza for my birthday. Last night when the clock struck 12:00 midnight, my best friend from school poured beer on me. We also dropped ashes from each others cigarette into each others beer and drank it. That is our new tradition we will carry on for years. Jeanie is a great friend. I wish she would come to UT instead of     SWT, I know she wants to . well time is up so BYE.    "
"I'm really worried about shannon I wonder if shes going to be ok it scares me a lot. I'm never known anyone my age to have something serious like that. I wonder if it was cause by anything like a cell phone or living by a tower or whatever. it makes me wonder if that could happen to me. I'm not sure why people smoke. its such a disgusting habit, but people seem to do it because it looks cool and because other people are doing it. I could understand why people smoked in high school it made you bad or something but not it just hurts your health and makes you ugly. I need to go brush my teeth. I wonder what reid is doing. he is so hot, I really would like to get with him, and I'm starting to lose intrest in chris. I feel trapped by him. I love being able to call on him whenever I want to do something. he's sort of my conveinent boyfriend. I guess that's not fair to him, but I'd almost rather it just be this way. I have a voice mail. who could that be from. I wonder when they will fix my phone. I love talking on the phone. I miss my mom. I don't miss my dad. I wonder how to tell him not to come home for parents weekend. I hate him. he'll maake me fell miserable either way. they are coming to fix my phone. thank god. I wonder if my date tonight will be cute. I like that outfit I wore last night. I really love suzanne and kristin and kleigh. suzanne is so awesome, but I wish we were all in the same sorority. actually no I don't. this way we have 3 close friends from different sororities and I have becoem good friends with megan joanie and tara. tara's awesome. I love all my sisters. I wonder what will happen when christy comes in town. I hope her and brian break up so I can set him up with someone. he's a good guy she doesn't deserve him. I think they're relationship is completely sexual. I wonder if I'll ever get married. I wonder if my dad will ruin that day for me too. I wonder if my mom will get married. I am embarassed of my parents sometmes. that makes me feel like such a bad person, but I can't help it. I love my mom. I wonder if anything bad will happen to brian because of those shirts he stole. I think that is so wrong. mike plays guitar. I wish I palyed guitar. acoustic not electric. I'd like to be able to play brown eyed girl. I wonder if I could be on staff for asp. I wonder if I could be a camp texas counselor. that counsleor that made me ""hiney write"" was awesome. he was a cool guy. doug is awful. I hope I never get played. I wonder if I'm playing chris. I would feel better if he would date someone else. god I wonder where reid is right now. he has no friday classes. my suitemates phone is ringing. are they up. do tehy have class. will she ever stop drinking?  I hope she learns to slow down. she's an alcoholic. that guy was not even cute. I should talk to her. kathryn is cool. I want kathryn to amke a painting for me. I like fruit loops. yum. are we out of milK?  damn I have to buy cheese. I want a quesdilla. why did that boy stop by at2?  what an idiot. I'm probably more likely to help him. I like the body builder next door. he likes me too. I wonder if angie chappel and kyle talked about me. she seemed to be very curious about chris being my boyfriend or not. I feel like a bitch when I think this, but I wish kyle would shave his go-t. who arranged the keyboard?  why are they in this order. I think its easier to have it this way then in alphabetical order. you use the letters asdf allot. and jkl. and ert. I wonder if sesame street is on. I liked bert and ernie. there was an episode of my so called life where rayanne sang how to get to sesame street. it was awesome. I hate that girl from the tri-delt house. I don't' know why they don't like me. I wonder what to wear tonight. damn it I need to study. has it been 20 minuts. how come I don't have any hot professors?  I like ut. I don't want to drink anymore. am I going to get fat?  kleigh is cute. I wish I had her figure. some people are lucky. I love my bed. its so soft. its lunchtime I'm not hungry. I wish I were skinny like andrea. I wonder if wolfe likes me. I think I scared him last night with my story about the elevator. why do the elevatros ehre take so long. I can't believe what happened to me and chris in the elevator. that was so emabarssing, and yet I can smile/laugh at it. chris is cool. i have a lecutre to go to today. I have to read. I have to work out. I have to call whats his anem and tell him I can't go. I don't think kleigh will go. what to do. "
"I'm not quite sure what to write about, and I highly doubt that anything interesting will come out of this paper! It makes me nervous to turn in a paper that I won't have time to proofread or check over. One of my English teachers used to take off points exponentially for every grammar error in the paper! Luckily my teachers aren't like that and this is the first paper I've had to write so far. Which is a good thing, I'm definitely not complaining. It is also the first actual homework assignment I have had, the rest is just reading and reading and more reading! Luckily most of it is interesting. I know in high school they said that college would be much harder and that there is more homework, but I don't think so. It isn't harder because there is more time to accomplish things in. the. Besides, teachers aren't so anal here. Maybe it's just UT, but I love it! I love the liberal attitude! Anyway, my roommate is due back at any second. Everytime I hear doors slam or flip flops coming this way, I think it is her. It's a bit distracting, although I guess in a way I already am distracted. I just don't know what to write about! I really hope this paper isn't graded on content! But Rachel, my roommate, is really nice. She thinks she is a witch, which I thought was incredibly weird, but whatever. I haven't seen anything weird since I've been here. Unless one considers a tarot reading weird that is. She did a reading on the phone to her boyfriend of three weeks that she has never met! Isn't that weird? I can't imagine that relationship going anywhere. But it makes me feel glad that I have Michael. He is been my boyfriend for two years, and now that we are in different cities, it's hard! I think he is taking it harder than I am, but I don't know how to help him! I guess that if the situation was reversed, I would be freaking out too. It's just that I have so many things to do here, that I can't talk to him every single time he wants to. Maybe things will improve with time. I finally found the lyrics to Enya's song called ?Only Time. ? It really has a great message, although almost all of her songs do. As the title implies, she talks about how only time knows everything. Time knows if you will stay married or if your troubles will go away. Knowing that is great, it's just hard. Kind of like the saying ?easier said than done. ? It's hard waiting for things! Not material things necessarily, but for success and happiness and similar things. I guess that's what everyone wants; happiness. I'm scared that I won't find it in my future work. Even though I love helping people and I know Social Work is a great thing, social workers make less than $30,000 a year! It makes me wonder if I have some greater purpose in life. So many things interest me that I feel pressured in choosing what to follow through with. A friend of mine has the same problem and she said ?I feel like I have 10 souls inside of me and each wants to do a different thing. ? And I feel the same way! Ideally I just want to make a difference and help people. I'm sure that somewhere in the next four years I will figure out what I want to do. It makes me wonder how other people just automatically know what they want to do. Is it because they are really good at something and want to follow through with it, or is it just because they made a random decision and want to stick with it? Who knows! I have nothing to do all night which is the perfect chance to study, but for some reason I just can't concentrate. Maybe it's because I took a nap and now all I want to do is go back to sleep! For the first few weeks I was sleeping wonderfully, but I haven't been able to for the past few days. Maybe Pennebaker's talk about college kids having sleep problems affected me! I doubt it though. But it is great being in Psychology. Although the book can be a bit boring sometimes, some of the subjects are incredibly fascinating and I can relate to most of them! Michael laughs at me all the time because I am constantly trying to justify things in life by what I learn in psychology. He has a terrible memory, so when I learned about the hippocampus or the amygdala or whichever it was, I immediately thought of him. And of course he laughed at me and thought I was silly to think that he had a medical deficiency since he couldn't remember things well. Oh well I guess! At least he loves me! Well, I have one more minute and I don't know what I'm supposed to close this off with, but I guess that means I'm supposed to keep rambling on. I would be really interested in seeing what kind of study these are being used for, if any. I would love to see what people wrote about. Probably friends and school, which seems to be what mine is dominated by, but maybe not! "
"I think I have one of the shortest attention spans. For some reason I can't concentrate on one thing for more than fifteen minutes. I was never diagnosed as A. D. D. though. I don't think I'm A. D. D. I just think I don't put forth the effort to concentrate. I was trying to read for English, but I couldn't keep my mind on it for anything. Every time I sat down to read I go sleepy. I try to stay focused, but it's hard. I wonder why my concentration is so limited. I think it all depends on what I'm interested in . I can read things relating to the human anatomy all day, but I have trouble focusing on things dealing with English or history. My mind often starts wondering. I've really had to adjust these first few weeks. Not only did I have to adjust academically, but socially. Even though I have a group of best friends, I still miss my friends back home. My mom, sister, and I are best fri3nds, and it's is pretty hard because I can't just pick up the phone and call them. It took a couple of day for me to realize this. I also have a boyfriend back home. This has also been hard. It's been hard for both of us. We were in the habit of talking everyday, and seeing each other quite often, now he's three hours away. I think he's taking it a little harder than I am. I'm keeping busy so I'm not constantly thinking about him. There's so much going on here. Between keeping on top of all of my classes, and hanging out, there's no more time left in the day. We've been having so much fun. The other five girls I hang out with are great. We all bonded so quickly. They really help to keep me focused on what I need to do. Of coarse with a group this big personalities flare, and we have disagreements, but surprisingly instead of holding grudges we talk it out. Females are stereotyped as being gossipy, and shady. Yes we do gossip, but if we say something behind someone's back, you can guarantee it's already been said to their face. So far everything's been going pretty smoothly. I hope this bond that is present now remains present for the next four years. It's difficult to say if it will because we can't  predict the future, and people change. When we're just sitting around we talk about our future as friends. I've already asked them to be bridesmaids at my wedding. Who knows when that will be. I don't plan for it to be any time soon, but I do hope our friendship will at least last that long. Friendship is a very important thing to me. It gives a sense of warmth, and belonging. It's like we have known each other for years. I hope nothing, but good will come out in due time. "
"     My nose is really stuffy right now and I had a fever earlier today but I think it's gone now. I hate not being able to breathe. I can hear the television right now. There's a commercial about honey barbecue wings. I can also hear my room mate typing and clicking her mouse. It's really cold in my room. I'm glad I decided to put my sweater on or I would be extremely cold. I can't really smell anything because of my stuffy nose. My stomach is growling. I have a craving for pizza. Maybe I'll go get some as soon as I finish this assignment. My room mate seems to be frustrated right now. I just heard her sigh. She has a test tomorrow that she needs to study for. She is mad because we weren't able to get football tickets for the OU game in Dallas. I kind of wanted to go and was getting excited about going to it. The television just mentioned something about getting pizza. Now my craving for it is increasing. I can taste it now. It's hard to type for 20 minutes straight. The phone just started ringing and distracted my train of thought for a while. My room mate just left the room to go open the door. I can watch the television from where I am sitting in front of my computer. My room mate's brother just walked in. Now all I can think about is what he is saying and I can't arrange my thoughts now. I just gave my room mate's brother my graphing calculator and showed him how to use it. I can't think of what to type any more. I am quickly running out of ideas. Time is passing really slowly. Typing for 20 minutes is really hard. My room mate is still talking about the OU football tickets. She is getting rid of her wristband and now I am thinking how I need to take mine off too. What other homework do I have?  I don't feel like going to my calculus class tomorrow. It is the most boring class I have because all we do is work out problems. I should go to the discussion session today, but I would rather go shopping with my friend. I keep sniffing. I still wish I could breathe. I think that not being able to breathe is the most annoying thing in the world. I feel as though I want to chop off my nose just so I don't have to feel congested any longer. Is this feeling normal?  Wanting to chop off my nose?  Everytime I get congested I feel the exact same way. Now I am starting to think that there is something wrong with me for wanting to chop off my nose. Oh well, I bet it is a perfectly normal feeling when you are sick and frustrated. I wonder what caused me to become congested. I heard that a lot of people have been sick today. Maybe something is going around. I always get sick. I have the worst immune system. My stomach keeps growling, but I am not sure if I want to eat because I feel as though I shouldn't eat because I want to lose weight although all my friends say that I am crazy for feeling this way. They keep telling me that I am perfectly fine the way I am. I still don't believe them because they don't see what I see in the mirror everyday. I've been told that I have a contorted way of looking at myself and that when I look in the mirror I see something different from what everyone else sees. But isn't that true for a lot of people?  Don't a lot of people see themselves in the mirror and not like what they see?  I think that it is perfectly normal to feel this way. What isn't normal though is acting upon it. Oh well. I can still hear the television and sometimes it distracts my thoughts because I begin to pay more attention to what is on the tv rather than my own thoughts. Now I want goldfish because I just heard the commercial. I can't think of what to type again. I think that this assignment causes us to think too much about what to type and that it puts us on the spot so that we freeze up and are no longer able to type what we think because we keep trying to type interesting things and not simply what is really on our minds. My room mate just laughed. I wonder why she laughed. I can hear the people out in the hallway. These walls are really thin because I can always hear what is going on outside. The refrigerator noise is really annoying. It's so loud. I feel sick still. I just want to go lay in my bed and sleep forever. I never get enough sleep. I always end up staying up really late and then I feel dead in the morning. My foot is falling asleep as well as my hands. I have the worst circulation in the world. Why is it that my feet and hands are constantly falling asleep no matter what position I put them in. I think it has to do with the fact that I don't get the proper nutrients. My hands are starting to get tired now. I can't wait until I am finished typing. I have about 2 minutes left and actually it wasn't really that hard to type for 20 minutes consecutively. I wonder how long everyone else's writing assingments are. I bet some of them will be longer than mine because a lot of people can type faster than I can. Oh well so much for that because it's too late now to start typing faster. I could try but then it would just seem pointless. My contacts are getting dry and it's getting hard to see the screen. I hate sitting at my desk and now my arms are starting to hurt because they are in a weird position. I am almost finished now and almost time to stop.

"Today I had my third day of classes at UT. It is still scary to walk around with so many faces that I have never seen before. I see all the older students and they are so confident in what they do and I keep thinking that one day, I will know lots of people on campus and not feel as intimidated as I still do. My parents still intimidate me even though I don't live under the same roof as them anymore. I have all these responsibilities and they are still checking up on me all the time and I feel like I must make them proud of me. I guess I will always feel that way. My mom once told me that she still feels like she has to do what her mother thinks is right, but she has learned to not feel guilty for a decision she feels is the best one. My boyfriend thinks I try to please to many people and I need to start doing what I want. I guess he doesn't know that I try to please him the most. He thinks he is not one of the people that makes me unhappy. He is older and he thinks he knows more than I do, but went to A&M so there is no way that is true. Most of my friends stayed in Austin, but some of by best friends went to far away places and I already miss them a lot. I live with three of my best friends from high school. My room roommate and I get along great and have been friends since we were five, and the other two I have known since we were eleven. So far everything is going well in our new apartment, but one girl has decided it is not her job to clean anything, and we are going to have to talk to her about that. Three people can take care of an apartment, but we would all rather not. She is just taking advantage of the rest of us doing it. She doesn't even offer to do dishes or cook, or go to the store, but she complains when she doesn't like what we have to eat around the house. She is eighteen years old and she is getting married in ten months and really feels like she is ready to make that kind of commitment. I know things worked out for my parents, but it seems like people were different back then. She is really spoiled and I think we need to put her in her place. She is a sweetheart, but I can't figure out why she won't wait until after college to get married. That is just going to be an extra load, and more obstacles. They won't have enough money for all the things they want and will fight because they aren't happy. When we try to tell her these things of course she doesn't listen. She is sure what she is doing is right. Maybe for her it is, what am I to say. I could never get married at this age right now. My boyfriend and I have been together for three years and have mentioned the possibility of it way down the line, but there is definitely not a seven thousanddollar ring on my hand. I also don't think I want to get married because I want to make sure that this is really the guy for me. My roommate has never even dated another guy and the first relationship she gets into she thinks she wants to marry the guy. I think one of my roommates feels left out because she is the only one of us without a boyfriend. She is the sweetest girl, but not all guys like her. She never complains about it, but I think maybe she is bothered a little. I know she will find someone at this school, though, it is very big and there are lots of fish in the sea. "
"god I can still remember it. the last time we did that was at our graduation party. one of our friends that night was a real bitch. the party even though their were 4 of us had to have it her way. but she is going to live ion McAllen for the rest of her life and  of course the next time I will see her is when she is taking my fast food order  I am so happy to be here the guys are a big improvement from where I'm am from  tall and cute a real McAllen novelty. oh and the cafeteria guy is the best so far. this Friday I have instillation for apo.

"I just ate and am full. I feel a little stressed trying to write in a flow and finding enough things to write for 20 mins. This is probably one of the strangest things I've ever had to do but that's why this class is so interesting  I'm so excited to major in it. I'm having a bad morning, because I slept late and now I feel that my whole day is ruined. It's so weird to be doing homework like this, I guess I'm just not used to this. I'm so glad this class is so different. I also love philosophy too. I really feel like sleeping right now, however my scholastic obligations are more important right now. This is such a pivotal moment in my life, as I embark on college life. Right now I'm actually very proud of myself for getting all of my studies taken care of, rather than succumbing to sleep, as every college student would like to do. I feel like my roommate is really impressed with me as I click away at this computer so concentrated and intent on this assignment. I'm having trouble concentrating because the phone keeps ringing, and Riana keeps talking on the phone. I get distracteed very easily, and am not good at concentrating while there are distractions about. Right now I'm getting irritated, because she is always on the phone with her boyfriend and I cannot concentrate. She's always with him, and I can't be with mine because he lives in college station, and I'm sad because were growing apart, and I can't stop it from happening, and I'd really like to. He's so perfect, but I'm beginning to think there's more out there, and that gives me a terrible feeling inside, because I love him so much, and he's my best friend in the world, and the last thing I want to do is hurt him, so I may just lay a passive role in the relationship until I can settle things in my mind. I feel so odd confiding in a perfect stranger like this, but then again no one may ever read this. I have so many confusions and distractions here. My friend is getting screwed over by a guy who keeps telling me he's in love with me. I loved this guy as a friend,  but I've lost so much respect for him, by the way he's playing games with my friend's head. I got my first speeding ticket yesterday, and surprisingly, the only thing I was upset about was the fact that I have to ruin a Saturday in defensive driving. This assignment wears you out-my fingers are aching. I'm really worried that when I finish this and press submit, it won't submit, because I accidentally pressed it before, and at the bottom of my computer screen it says done. My very first assignment , and I've probably already messed it up. I guess I'll have to explain the problem to the professor, and hope he understands that I've never used the internet before, and I am an idiot for messing up. well I guess I'll end on this paranoid note, because I really want to do well, and make a 4. 0 this semester. No one believes me, but I have high hopes and determination, and I won't let them bring me down. Well I guess I didn't end on such a bad note after all, but if that's what you need to make it, then I guess I'll end up ok after all "
"Although I have waited until the very last minute to start this assignment, it was totally out of my control. I've been dealing with getting my laptop and setting up my Internet for about two weeks now. The Ethernet card was finally put into today, but only after harassing the front desk of my dorm about twenty times. So, now I'm connected to all my friends who either moved or do not go to UT. But, even though I might be connected, I barely ever get any real information about their lives from them. One of my best friends moved to College Station to go to school. It might be only a twohour drive, but I haven't seen her in almost a month. That is really hard when before she left we were seeing each other almost every day. And, I don't feel I'm making enough of a conscious effort to keep in touch with her. Maybe I think that if I don't speak to her then I won't miss her. I've also been overwhelmed with the changes of moving away from home, meeting new people, and getting adjusted. So, I might just be extremely busy right now, too much on my mind. I've wanted to graduate high school and be on my own since I was about twelve. I've always been extremely responsible and independent, not really seeing the need for strict authority, parents, teachers, etc. So, I figured moving out of my house and into a new environment would be a breeze. I've adjusted all right. I do my homework, don't stay out late on school nights, and go to all my classes. Psychologically though is a different story. I never realized how much I'd miss my parents, and only now do I really appreciate what they do for me. I got sick about the second week I moved into my dorm, and all I could think about was how I wanted my mom to take care of me. Me, miss independent just wanted someone to cook soup for her and tell her what kind of medicine to take. Also, dealing with campus size has been kind of hard. I grew up in a small town and went to a small high school where I practically knew everyone. I am living with a friend from high school, so that's made it a little easier. But still, I don't feel like an individual anymore. I feel like one in a huge crowd, which is exactly the case. Especially in this class. How do you get to know people when you sit by someone different every day and there are over five hundred people that walk through the doors? That's almost three times my graduating class. Five hundred is half the town of Dripping Springs. It's so different, and yet I'm only thirty miles away from home. I also haven't really found much to get involved with. I'm not into sports, and at this point I haven't really experienced anything that I love doing and want to pursue. The only thing I've really done as a group is me, my roommate, and a friend from one of my classes went to a Pill Start class. Which is what it sounds like, starting birth control. That's another thing, I got to this class, yet I'm not sexually active, and I feel like such a minority here in college. I went to the class as a preventative measure. You now, a just in case it happens when I'm drunk or not thinking straight, or maybe even if I get into a relationship where I actually trust my partner. I have this huge overwhelming fear of pregnancy, and I think that's stopped me from being intimate. And, I'm not sure if that's a good thing. Yeah, it has kept me from having sex, but I'm also in a state of fear about the issue. I'm worried my sister, my friends, anyone and everyone is going to get pregnant and that scares me. I worry so much about other people, and I feel responsible for them. Like, I'm always offering to take so and so to go get birth control. Then, they look at me like I'm a freak and explain to my how there's really no way they can get pregnant. I mean, they are using condoms. And all I can do is look at them and think ""OH My God!"" How can anyone be so nonchalant about such an important issue? If I ever got pregnant my life would change so much. It's way too much to even think about. And, I don't ever want to have to make the decision of if I should keep the baby. I love children so much, but I don't want them now, when I can't provide for them or give them the life I know they deserve. But, I don't really think abstinence is the answer either. I think that at some point I'm going to just have to get over this fear. I don't have a problem with sex; I just have a problem with all the scary things that can result from it. Ten minutes of pleasure is not worth disease, death, or even a new life (right now). "
"well, I don't really know where to begin. it's my 3rd week of school and I guess it's going okay. my classes are getting harder but I suppose I'm getting into the ""rountine"" of things. i don't know wether I'll go to the ISA meeting today cause I know what kind of peeps will be there but I am definetely going to the SSA meeting. i think that'll be a really fun club cause of the people that are in it. the social this saturday should be cool. i havne't called mom today so I should do that before I leave for the meeting. on friday, I am finally going to meet this girl that I haven't seen ever since freshman orientation. i have so much stuff to tell her. that's one of the things that I really hate about college. that it's so hard to make plans with people. and that you can only catch them at certain times cause no one's in their room all the time. damn, we have this cricket in our room right now and I don't know where it is. i've tried looking for it so many times but I can't find it. it keeps chirping every now and then, sort of letting us know that it's still there. haha. ti's so annoying cause at night the little thing thinks it's outside so it just chirps away. anyway, what else is going on. i don't really like my calculus class cause everyone in there is really snobby and already attached to their own group of friends. i don't know how that happened and where I was, but whatever. you'd think in a class like calculus there'd be a bunch of nerds, but not at all. i have to go shopping soon. i need one of those wallets with the key chain thingy attached to it. that would make my life so much easier. it's strange how little things can make your day go a lot smoother. like, getting down to the cafeteria right before it closes. or meeting someone after a long time and spending the whole day with them. or getting a call from someone you love. or realizing that you're going to be okay at UT. or getting a good night's rest after a long time. those kinds of things. okay, that was a really weird tangent. anyways, um. got nothing to say. oh, okay. i find it really hard to get on line once I'm at college. i dunno. i just feel like it's a chore to talk to people or write really long letters and I'm sure my friends are getting a little ticked that I'm doing that. but, I just feel like I'm wasting my time on the comp. i really want some grapes right now. i went to HEB yesterday and I got all this fruit. actually, I think I got too much. but anyways, I got the really big maroon seedless ones. oooh, they are the best. i wish they had better shopping places on the drag. either it's too expensive, or the clothes just suck. I feel like going out today cause I don't have a class till one tommorrow. maybe to a nice restaurant or something. well, actually, I'm finding it really hard to make myself do something. like, for examle, I need to mail out the thank you cards for my graduation party, as it is, they are already 3 weeks late. and I just don't have the will to do it. i mean, I see them everyday sitting on top of my desk, but I jsut don't do it. and I have to look at my bills and balance my checkbook and stuff but I hate doing that kind of stuff. i dunno. i guess I'm just getting too lazy. the other day someone accused me of that, and proved it to him by doing something taht I would have ordinarily not done and when I told him about it yesterday. he just said that I did it for me not for him. it didn't really make a difference to him wether I did it or not. and I realized that was true. when you do something out of spite, you're not doing it for anyone else but yourself. i miss my mom. i need to send her a card soon. "
"Hmmmm. What am I going to write for my stream of consciousness. I don't even know if I spelled that word right. Oh, well. I guess I just write whatever comes into my head. By the way, I have to fill out my daily schedule for my EDP 310 class. Don't forget about that. It's kind of hard to type whatever comes into my head because my hands aren't as fast as my thoughts. (That's obviously a good thing). What's on my mind. This is a lot harder than I thought. Sometimes there is absolutely nothing in my head and I just draw a blank. Nothing to write about. I wish that I can draw pictures on this thing but I can't. I tend to be a more visual person and I get a lot more pictures in my head than words. I think I'm going a bit over twenty minutes, although it doesn't seem like it. I just sit here at my computer and think sometimes because I want something to pop in my head so I can write it down, but nothing happens. It seems like when you want your mind to wander, it has a harder time doing it, but if you're trying to concentrate on something, like when you're taking a test, your mind can't stop wandering. I guess that's the amazing thing about the brain. so unpredictable. At least to the untrained individual who doesn't know what to look for it seems unpredictable. Maybe not so much for an expert. Its funny how the mind works. Anyway, I don't want to get all philosophical or psychological or anything so I think that my time is up. Until next time. Ooohhh my arm itches  "
"ow. I just hit my knee on the table and it hurt. I bump intot stuff a lot. I think that it's because I don't pay much attention or maybe because I'm trying to pay attention to other things and the other things consume my brain until it's full and there's no time to think about  the wall in front of me. I ramble a lot too and I don't mean to. the light in my apartment is still broken. I've told the people at the management place and I don't think they care. they definitely don't care about the bugs living in my kitchen. my knee still kind of stings. these lights are really bright inn my eyes, and I'd turn them off, but then my computer would go off because the power won't flow through the lights unless they're on which is stupid. what if I don't like having the lights on?  what if I'm one of those crazy people who sits in their place doing nothing, not talking to anybody and having no contact with the world and this light is disturbing my peace because the only way I can have peace is to be completely inn the dark all the time. good thing I'm not like that. I don't type as well as I wish I did. my aunt types really fast and brags about it too. I forgot to send this insurance bill to my dad, I hope it's not overdue. I already scratched the car too , so he is probably not too happy with me right now, even though he wouldn't say he wasn't happy with me. he is always so. why didn't he get mad when I told him I scratched the car?  it bugs me sometimes when people don't get mad when they should. like when I messed up the sherwin williams breakfast coupons and kevin didn't yell at me. he is too nice. he probably gets mad behind my back, and that is worse. he is fake and I don't like fake people. give me reality or give me nothing , because fake is a load of crap, and crap is never good. that girl in my freshman seminar is so horrible. she is fake if I ever saw it. she actually smiled at me today when I know for a fact that she despises me. she really does, just because I have strong opinions and happened to say one of my opinions about baptists. not even anything bad about baptists, just that they're phonies, most of them. I don't know why she cares, she not baptist or even a christian. she doesn't know what she really thinks, so she tries to pick up opinions that aren't hers and make them her own. only she can't back them up because she doesn't really believe them and they aren't really right anyway. she is wishy washy and I don't like that either. believe what you're going to believe and the hell with everyone else. who cares if they don't like what you're saying, because you like what you're saying and that's just who you are. hiding who you are isn't true to yourself. they'll eventually find out what you really are and what you really believe anyway, so who cares if it's now or later. I like sharing my opinion. I even like it when people get mad or offended. I don't know why, I just think it's funny. lots of people get offended easily. natalie sure did have an awful look on her face that one time. I can't believe she was scared of me, that's so stupid. she was afraid I thought she was stupid. boo hoo, who cares what I think anyway. we were friends for years and suddenly she is scared that I think she is dumb. of course she is dumb, but I would never tell her that, and I certainly never did anything that should have made her feel like she is dumb. I think only strong people can handle me. that's ok because I only like strong people anyway. weak minds make me sick. not stupid minds, but weak minds. minds that don 't know or don't think or don't care about anything, because what's the point. if I can't talk to you I don't want to know you. private school you had to hang with people you didn't like. you sit by yourself one day on purpose and they all flock around to see if you're ok. yeah, I'd be okay if you were gone, but you can't say that because they would hate you and you'd never have any friends because they would tell everyone what you said and then you'd be EVIL, god forbid. God forbid anyone has a rough day and just wants to be alone, away from the fake laughs, fake jokes, stupid people. I hate stupid people. I'm sorry, I'm a mean person. I don't mean to be. that guy sitting next to me was killing me with his breath today in class. he is fake to. I hate when people ask me how I like austin so far. why the hell do they care anyway. everyone has the same generic response and the same bla bla bla bla bla answer, I hate asking people stuff like that so I don't and I expect people to return the courtesy. but how would they know that I hate that. they don't know me there's no way they COULD know. or they could guess , but no ones too good at that. I am so tired. that customer service guy was nice. I wonder if he is cute. he is probably a nerd. what do I mean, probably, probably definitely he is a nerd. computer people usually are. my friend hit on me the other day. I don't think I have any guy friends anymore. all of my guy friends keep hitting on me, which sucks, because then I feel weird around them. are they really friends or are they just trying to get some who really knows for sure. I think all guys are sick like that. all of them are jsut totally, totally, sick, they can't help it. they can't just be normal, they have to go screw things up "
"Just sitting down and actually listening to your thoughts has become a rare event for most adolescents. I think it would be wise if I put myself on a quiet place and just thought about things such as my life, beliefs, and future. Today I went to a meeting for KVR News and received tons of information about the station and what I needed to do if I wanted to be apart of it. The meeting was extremely informative, almost too informative. My head was spinning by the time I left the station. I learned so much and that was only the tip of the iceberg. I feel as though I am behind in life right now. I'm definitely already behind in my schoolwork, but in other things too. I still feel as though as I am at camp not in my new home. My other friends already feel comfortable here. It also seems like there are numerous assignments and activities that I can't fit into a twenty four hours! I miss my best friend named Dana. She went to Tulane. She is doing well which makes me happy. Speaking of happiness, certain things in my life these days are causing me to experience extreme happiness. This is impressive because a year ago I was debating whether or not anyone could obtain true happiness. Now I am a firm believer. You see, about three months ago I met a beautiful guy by the name of John. He is intelligent, funny, artistic, and the best boyfriend a girl could ask for. This has been the longest not to mention the only serious relationship I have ever been in. John makes me feel pretty. He looks out for me and he loves me. When I am with him I am completely happy. Another strong catalyst to my blissfulness is food and the Jester Cafeteria has been coming through. Of course, I have to focus in quantity not quality! Whenever I eat there I get lost in the selections. So much to eat so little space! Though I reach these peaking moments of happiness, every once in a while they disappear. When I was filling out my pretesting questionnaire I started to feel depressed. All the questions were bringing up topics and ideas that made me think about how I handled issues. I'm not good at issues. I tend to bottle things up. I'm not good at verbalizing my emotions. This combination is dangerous. Sometimes I wonder if I have made wise choices. I wonder if my parents miss me. I wonder if my friends long to see me too. My selfconfidence is like one crazy roller coaster. One minute I am a gorgeous intellectual woman who knows what she wants and the next I am an ugly confused little girl who can't figure anything out. It is a good thing for me to acknowledge these things and occurrences in my life. I am very thankful for what God has given me. "
"The on e thing in my mind right now is obviously college. I didn't really have to study to get past high school, but I foresee a lot of changes in my schedule, just 20 min ago I did ALL my math homework for the first time in maybe a year. If studying was my chief concern than I would be perfectly satisfied. Unfortunately that is not my only concern. I am originally from Houston, so as much as I hate to admit it I miss my home, and even my parents. there are so many things about home that I miss, thing that I nerve thought would matter, things like going to the bathroom. Well I miss the past, and I am worried sick about the future. How will I do in my first test?  How will I register for spring classes?  Will I have enough hours to graduate with a BS degree in biology?  Will I get into Medical school? If I don't get into Medical school, then what will I do?    Obviously time is the only thing that will answer these questions. but you can not help but worry about them. Ever since I was little I wanted to be a doctor. Well not from the beginning, I have wanted to be a doctor ever since I was 11. That is when I had a brain surgery. After that I wanted to use the life that was saved by another as a tool to save other people. There have been a lot of changes that have occurred in me but one thing that has stayed consistent within me is my passion to help others. The one thing that made me feel occurred when I was 5. My grandfather and I were walking down a street when we ran into a beggar. my grandfather had just bought me my favorite kind of ice cream. When my grandfather took the ice cream from me and gave it to the beggar. at that time I hated I'm for it. . but when I went to sleep that night all I could see was the gleam in the eyes of that beggar. it was at that time that tears starting coming out of my eyes. I felt proud that I had participated in something so beautiful. Being a doctor to me is the best to repay god, and my family, and those doctors that saved my life.  The one thing that I am afraid of is the one thing most people are afraid of. failure. Fear of failure has always driven me forward, it is my opinion that fear of failure is the one thing that keeps this world going. everybody has a goal in their life and the fear of failure makes them work as hard as possible. hopefully one day I will walk out of a doctor as a doctor, who just helped saved someone life. . that would be a dream come true. "
"1  Freestyle- trying to write down thoughts that are moving so slowly now-- after spending the day walking up and down the Drag so many times (seems like millions!) in the hot sun. then waiting in line for this computer for ages. I wonder if this is right because its only making one long line instead of lots of lines Maybe I was supposed to press RETURN! Cant think right now except about going home to my new apartment, which is the first apartment that I've ever had. Very big, clean, airy, light, very TEXAS. I wish I had an apartment that was more original, as if there were only one like it in the whole world. With hardwood floors  and pets allowed. So I could get a Lasa Apsa. But Im going to sneak a ferret into my place because they are the CUTEST!!! You can bend them in half and twist them around everywhere and they are so playful. Anyway if I had a ferret I would name it Camilla cuz we used to have a kitten named Camilla but we had to give it  away. If I had two children I always thought I would name them Madeline and Jack, but now Im not sure because Jack sounds like a name for a psychopath--- like in the Shining. These are the ultimate boring thoughts but my brain is in slow motion so oh well. Im absolutely starving right now I could eat yum pasta and artichokes and sushi and olives and steak (not all together!) I have weird taste in food because of growing up overseas I can remember being so little and my parents would take us out for Asian food-- me and Liz only four and five and eating spicy kimchi (MMMM) or fighting over what was the best piece of sushi. And when we only babies our favorite treat was FISH EYES, which I wouldnt be able to stomach now. That was in the Philippines, where we left when I was two, and my only memory of it is a grayish image of lizards on the window above my crib. Some memories are suspicious- like I wonder if they are really mine-- maybe at a young age (like 5 or 6), somebody told me how I loved the lizards outside my window and my mind just fashioned a blurry picture of the view from my crib. Its hard to believe that a person can remember things that happened such a long time ago, especially when you cant remember what you had for lunch the day before yesterday or the name of your high school Physical Science teacher (Mr. Stockwell??) My minutes are nearly up, thank God cuz I need FOOD! Which will probably be Capn Crunch or a tuna sandwich since we need to go grocery shopping. Interesting exercise, too bad my thoughts are nowhere near as beautiful as the stream of con. in Ulysses. Right now food is the main thing on my mind, thank you for reading this. "
"I have a paper to start writing for English, and I'm dreading it because it will be very hard. It's about the short story ""A Room of One's Own"" by Virginia Woolf. In that story she also wrote in sream of conciousness so that is kind of weird. I really do not like the book at all. It's incredibly boring. It takes a feminist standpoint of women writers, and since I am not a feminist and only took that class because it was all that was open (I wonder why),I cannot relate to the anger Woolf seemed to have about there not being many women writers. Now, I am trying to figure out exactly what else to write about in this paper. It is really hard for me. I did the other assignment first because I found it much easier to do then this one. I don't completely understand exactly what I am supposed to be writing about, but we did stream of consciousness in my AP English class last year, and I think that it's all about writing exactly what the thoughts are that come into your head as they come into your head. My geography class is awful. the teacher is so boring. I've almost fallen asleep every time I go into that classroom. I decided to sit closer today to try and pay closer attention to what he's saying. I wonder if it's just a myth that the closer you sit the more you pay attention. Maybe that could be a psychologiacal survey we do- if one has not already been done on that. Now, I have again drawn a blank in what to say. it's so much easier to think when you don't have the pressure of having to write it down. I think my fried Alison is mad at me. She goes to A&M, and I had to write her an email about A&M's unfortunate loss to FSU yesterday. It's not like she hasn't made fun of UT. I feel like I'm back in Jr. high!  Alison and I have been friends forever- actually only since 9th grade but it sure feels like forever. I miss my friends at home. I feel like we've gotten so distant from each other and it's only been a week since I left. I talked to my friend Ann last night, and she was distant to me also. We just didn't have much to say, our lives are completely different from each others now. It's so weird how much people change from each other when you change their surroundings. I guess we were so much alike because we were constantly together. that could have a big effect on things, huh?  I wonder how long my friendships with people will last. The only one that seems to be maintaining right now is with someone that I wasn't even very close to this year- it's so odd to me how that happens. This twenty minutes sure is taking a long time to end!  I have to go put some money in the bank today. Actually I have a ton of errands to run today, but I need to finish my homework first. I still have a lot of pages to read in ""A Room of One's Own"" even though it was supposed to be read by today. Oops!  Then I have that awful paper to write over it. I mean who really cares about Mary Carmichael, Mary Beton, and Mary Seton? I don't even know how to start writing it, I don't even completely know what I'm supposed to write about. Well, it's been twenty minutes and my thoughts are becoming jumbled so I'm going to stop writing now. "
"     Today is a very stressful day, I just studied for the first time and it makes me so mad because i am a perfectionist and when I don't understand something perfectly I get really frusterated. My boyfriend from back home has not called today because we broke up last night and it was for the stupidist reason. Why can't he just let me do what I want? I'm kind of homesick lately. People know all their friends from high school and I'm just alone from Wisconsin, besides Shane who is not being very nice lately. Well actually it's me not being very nice. It's really weird because my friends and I all have birthdays this week. Mine's on September 11th and it's not going to be a very fun birthday. It never really is. Two years ago my party got crashed by Richard and then last year it was 9-11. Hopefully it'll be really cool though with everybody remebering 9-11. I think it will. The fact that I have so many classes that day kind of sucks though. Oh well I think I've officially decided that I'm changing my birthday to september 12th. My friends and I are all going to Hardrock cafe that night to eat and then we might go to sixth street and party afterward. I called my mom today just to chat and of course she makes me mad and says basically that her and my dad thought I was going to drop out of school. They wanted to make sure that I had been studying. they don't realize that I am on my own now and that I can deal with my own problems myself. Janelle and I just found this new diet. You eat a lot of fruit in the morning and veggies and then at night you can feast and eat whatever you want. You have to eat in a certain order though at night. kind of weird and who knows if it will work but it better because I'm not going to gain the freshman fifteen. Thats going to be hard because the cafeteria food is so damn good and you can keep on going up for more servings. I palyed on a soccer team today. Our dorm got a coed team together and we all went to practice together. It was a good workout because it was so hot out. It was alot of fun, I scored three goals and I broke Darius' toe. OOPs! I feel kind of bad. I hate the fact that the last 2 weeks all I've been doing is having fun and not dealing with school. Now I realized that there's going to be alot of school wrk involved. I also want to prove my mom wrong and get a really good GPA. I set goqals for myself today because I was reading a book at   Barnes and Noble and I said that I was going to do good in school and study at least an hour a night. Hopefully I can do that. I think I will be able to. I can't believe that Shane hasn't called yet. I either thought he'd call at 10am or not at all. Oh well there's more out there. I am having a lot of fun here though, so I don't really care if we break up.   "
"It's funny how people allow themselves to be manipulated by words. I was just reading my Philosophy book, and different philosophers were arguing the pros and cons of legalizing drugs. As I read I found myself being manipulated by words. I had to step back and look at things as a whole to determine my own view on situations. I think many people are victims of the society that we have created. We live in a cutthroat world that is very demanding. People feel pressured to please others above themselves. I believe that this can be dangerous. People too often define success by how much money they have, how many cars they have, and what their resume looks like. Many times we try to obtain success at all costs; even at the cost of our own happiness and well being. Students feel pressure from many sources. Many of those sources are our parents. They feel pressure to be a success in their parents eyes no matter what the costs. Even if the costs includes the well being of their self. This is a sad occurrence. We should be encouraged by our parents. Their is a thin line between encouraging and pressuring. We look for that line and do our best to walk as close to it as possible. Its funny how our state of mind changes from time to time. We go from being majorly stressed out to being very calm. Aristotle believed that we should always surf somewhere in the middle, never getting too high or too low. I think that makes some sense. Every time I get stressed out I have to step back and look at things in perspective. Then I ask myself if this ""thing"" I'm stress about is really worth it. More times than not it isn't. My question is what is the right way to live. If we never push ourselves we never allow ourselves a chance to grow. If we push ourselves too much we run the risk of becoming depressed. I guess like everything else, it all depends on the circumstances. Some things have a tendency to stick in my head. Movie lines for example. I'm always able to remember with great accuracy. Numbers on the other hand, I don't remember so well. What causes that? Is that a gift or a flaw? I have an identical twin brother and we are total opposites. I remember movie lines and he remembers phone numbers very well. Also, we look nothing alike. Isn't that weird. Every time we meet someone and tell them we're identical twins they never believe us. Maybe the doctor made a mistake and told my mom the wrong thing. Identical twins are cool because we have the same genetic makeup. I guess that takes the individuality away a little, but hey, its just like anything else, we've got to take the good with the bad. "
"Well, I have procrastinated on doing this assignment for long enough, and so I guess I should start working on it now. It's a thursday afternoon and all I'm doing is staying at the apartment to do this assignment. What a life! These stupid pop-ups keep on coming up, it's interrupting my thinking process. Let's see, I've been up here for about a month now, and I have yet been able to see and fun"" that everyone that went here or is going here claim. It's not that I want to be partying everyday, still I would like to see what's all the fuss's about. Then again, my life here at the apartment is great. I live with two roommates, each have their own eccentricity, still without them I would be bored out of my mind. These restaurants around here keep on posting flyers in front of my door- it's getting really annoying. I'm hungry, yet I don't want to go grab something to eat - does that make me lazy? Of course not! It's because I have to sit here for 20 minutes to write this assignment, yea that's it. During the day this place is so quiet, almost everyone that's living here goes to UT, so during the day they're at the campus. Maybe I should spend more time at the campus. Maybe that would help me get to know more people. I haven't made one single friend yet, well besides those people that I see in class everyday, those that I greet with a casual hello; however, I don't think of them as friends, just acquaintances. My computer desk keeps on shaking while I'm typing this, I should have brought a sturdier desk, but then how would it fit in here? This place is so cramped. Luckily, this weekend I'm going back home to Houston to get a bunk bed, and also to see my family and girlfriend of course. I miss my family very much, especially my dad. He have always been the strict yet caring figure that shadows every minute of my life up till now. Now, I have to be on my own, that's the only way that I will learn to grow up. I know he must be worried out of his mind right now, wondering what I'm doing up here, wondering how my health is, wondering how I'm doing in school, wondering how late I sleep, wondering how many times I eat in a day, etc. I know he worries, but the best I can do is call him every night just to let him know that I'm doing fine. I can't go back home, if I live with him, then he will take care of everything for me, then I will never learn to grow up. I miss my mom too, but I'm more attached to my dad because he is the only other male in our family of seven. The buses hear run pretty frequently, I just heard another bus pass by our apartment, this is pretty convenient. My roommate just got home, he is the bossy but cool one out of us. I'm like the normal one, well, besides my random outburst of course. My other roommate is the cool, quiet subtle one. It's always fun to pick on him, but we know our limits. Oh yea, VSA meeting is today, maybe I will get to know more people. Then again, I doubt it because I'm always quiet and reserved so I guess I won't talk much. Well, I'm going to wrap this up because the timer's about to run out. After this, I'm going to head to class, then it's VSA meeting. "
"My roommate is trying to ask me what we are going to do while I'm typing this. We played basketball for about two and a half hours. For some reason I played pretty good today, I usually don't play that good. I'm not really sure what to write, well I mean type. I went to a sorority date dash last night. It was pretty fun. They rented out some club on sixth street. I saw some people that I went to highschool with, and I didn't get home until about three so I'm really tired . I really doubt that I'll stay out that late tonight. Tomorrow I'm going to san Antonio for the beastie boys concert with these girls that I don't really know that well. I hope everyone has a good time. The next day is my grandpa's birthday and my entire family is going to meet at our ranch in Gonzales. That reminds me I have to get him a gift. I'll get him something from ut of course probably a hat or something. My suitemates went home this weekend, one lives in Arlington the other lives in deer Park. they are pretty cool guys. Sometimes they get on my nerves but I'm sure I get on people's nerves too. My roommate is going to a church thing right now. He said that the people there are really nice but they are extremist about how they worship, I think it makes him feel uncomfortable, I can relate I've been to some church functions like that. But he is also going because he met some girl there so he is getting the best of both worlds learning about god and hooking up with a girl. I WISH I COULD OF GONE. I can hear my neighbors radio through my wall incase you wanted to know. It kind of makes me want to turn mine on since my time with you is up. "
"I don't like having to write an my couch. I need a better place to work. I don't want to go to work tonight. I sometimes feel like a trained animal jumping through a hoop. I really want a dog. Somebody that will always be there for me. I thought I had that in my boyfriend. I was always there for him Why is it that I always find the guys that I like or care about are unstable. Is it because I myself am unstable and I want someone else to make me feel better about my soft insanity. Or do I project such an image of  pure stability that they desire. I would like to be in a stable right now. Talking to a stable and then an unstable person, while grooming a horse. I want a horse to be able to ride him fast an hard through an open field to a tree that I could climb. The last time I climbed a tree I was trying to escape being pursued by a guy who had a girlfriend. I should have probably just told him no. Should I be more aggressive? I think that I am not because I can feel at times so much what other people are feeling. I don't them to be hurt by me because I myself have been hurt enough. I have always wished for an average American family A dog, a house with a fence, 2. 3 kids. I never got that though. I am beginning to realize that I am glad that I didn't. I like the person I am very much. I still need much more from myself though. I wonder why I surround myself with the things that I do. Why do I make my home a haven. Why I am afraid. Why do I have Disney videos for kids or feel the need to buy myself flowers. I need more books I want more knowledge I don't want to be another close-minded individual in this cruel and cynical world. oxymoron. Jeremiah would like The Picture of Dorian Gray. I hope he will read it. Where am I right now  what do I need to be doing to get to my destination. I need to allow God back into my life. I need to stop shutting him out. I need to vacuum, and do laundry, paint, to do my chemistry, and talk to my soon to be ex-boyfriend. That is scary. I am going to alone again Why do I fear that so much. Maybe I am looking for the father I never had  I need someone to be there to praise me. I need to spend more time with more people. I put myself into seclusion to much But I like it My bicycles wheels are awfully big. they are huge,  I don't understand why guys always wish that they had a bigger penis even when they are large in the first place. Why do I have such a sexual mind. Have I Made myself that way for guys or am I naturally this way. Few things are natural anymore. I want to go camping and run through the Forrest naked like a nymph or a fairy. I want to appear magical to all those around me. "
"I have class at 3:30 today; I had better make it on time. After this I am going to go for lunch, I am feeling so hungry. Don't know how I will be able to keep writing for 20 minutes, seems like a long time. Parents are coming on Thursday night, have to go and finish off the work on Friday, better remember to finish calling about the computers today. There are so many people using the labs. I can't wait to get my computer back. We had better finish buying all the things we need this weekend. The TV people will be coming on Saturday; I think we need to buy a video as well. I should call Nimay and Maallika and see how they are doing. I forgot to email Cody again. Better call him. I mean mail him. Oh god, I am so tired, need to sleep some more. Good, there's a long weekend coming up. I am so happy I do not have class on Fridays. Oh, now I do, Sitar class. but then that is hardly class, it's more of fun than class. I hope he teaches something in the advance class that I can learn from. That Monday class was ridiculous, doing all the basics all over again! Just 7 minutes up. 13 more to keep writing. That guy looks familiar. Better finish off on all my work 2day and go study for that accounting quiz. It looks like it's going to be easy, if he does the kind of stuff he did in class yesterday, then it's going to B really easy. I hope I do well this semester, make the 4. 0 that I want to. Statistics and Psychology look like they are going to be hard; I hope I do well in both these classes. Winter break should be fun, am really looking forward to going back home. Going home is always nice; it's good that mom and Pop are coming this weekend. We should have a good time. We'll take all these people out to dinner; they'll like that to. Deepti's parents will be here as well. We should all go out together. We should go to that place we went to last time, it was really nice. I think we'll go to San Antonio as well this weekend, will be fun. I hope the weather is nice. I wonder which car we'll be renting?? I hope we rent a nice car. we'll need a big car. I need to work out how I'm going to get to the airport. probably take a cab, the bus won't be running so late. I should check up the bus schedule as well, probably have to buy it. Better buy the book for that India class, and the course packet as well. I'll ask Kristin and Twisha to buy it. they live at Dobie. I'll probably go to Dobie now, maybe buy it right away. Buy lunch there, probably go to their room and relax, I hope they are in their room. Otherwise I'll go to Malika or Nimay's room and chill there for a while. Jeez there are so man people living at Dobie. So many Indians, and so many freshmen. I think Dobie is a good place for freshman to live. An apartment is better, but then not that great an idea for freshman. I think Senior year I might live at Dobie, only because it so close and convenient. Otherwise it isn't a really great place to live. Lets see what happens. all that is so far away. "
I am at work right now but I dont start to work until about 30 more minutes I wonder if any one is  going to if anyone is going to ask me what I am doing oh well there is this person that I think is real nice so I cant really how does this thing work any way why won't it go to the next line by itself so I guess ill start to press enter when I cant see the words I am typing  I feel like laughing I dont really know why well I do but it would be  to dangerous for me to type them down. so one might see I wish I could go  home I just found out that my botany class test are short answers great. I still like the class though  cant wait fort he day to be over. I is supposed to rain today I want it to but I don't want to walk home or any where in this assignment is kind of hard I cant type as quick as my mind thinks I'm not sure I like this computer either well Im still skipping my thoughts  on the next assignment I think I better write it down instead. ok the truth  I did erase something from the beginning of this document. Im at work for goodness sakes. why do I keep putting periods down I guess it is hard to  write with out using punctuation also his voice sounds wonderful ok I've got to stop that oh well I didnt know that the top lines of the document eventually go up that a good thing she smiled at me probably wondering what I was doing I wish I had more time to write some more poems I will though I really want to perfect the one I wrote about the tanut this I going to look crazy when they print it out. I like this assignment though I never did ask if it was ok for me to be doing homework on the computers at work but mine at home is not fast enough to or doesnt have enough speed to get everything on the net on  my computer I rally want to  buy some more software for it but I dont know if I can afford it so this guy that I was telling you about is so fine I feel like I want to jump his bones I even had a dream about him last night nothing nasty though it wasnt even sexual so I wonder if they are going to see how many times a guy verses a girl brings up the topic of sex in their writings I hope my TA gets all of this information. anyway he's so sexy I have a boy friend thought it will be five years in November I dont believe it I love him though ok my mind has gone blank I cant think of anything I wish that when I write paper that the information I need to write him would flow a quickly as it is right now that would be cool so I could write a complete 12 page paper in one day I guess I would procrastinate one time though come to think of it yesterday I should have been writing my thoughts down I actually because aware became aware of what I was thinking it was kind of weird why to I keep trying to correct my mistakes maybe so it will be easier for the readier to follow I bet they are going to be having a grand time reading this class assignment I wonder what they are looking for. any way it would probably mess up the study if I did know. naked why I dont know so one to the next topic my the way I wasnt taking bout the Winston cigarette ads you know I don't smoke anyway well two more minutes until I have the file away my life at least to you its a play on words because it is part of the job description that I do I won't be doing it for the rest of my life though I do know that for sure actually Im not sure I know what I want to do bye. 't be doing it for                            
"I just got out of rugby practice. this is the first practice we have had with the veteran players. my body hurts and for some reason I can't sleep so i decided to do this. im too excited to do anything, but think about the next practice. it reminds me of playing soccer in highschool. we should have won state my sophomore year. we had the most talented team i had ever seen at that level. two of the players from that year actually play in the mls. I love rugby. I was never a very imposing guy until about my junior year of highschool and by that time it was too late to play football. so i kept playing soccer. but i've always wanted to just level the other team, and now I can do that. I missed biology this morning because is et my alarm for 7:30 pm instead of 7:30 am. I hate when i do things like that. I miss summer school at UT. It was so much more fun than the fall. Everyone hung out together, and we could all get in to any party no matter if we were rushing or not. Now I'm lucky if I see one of the people from summer just once a week. Fall was suppose to be better. A girl that was my best friend in highschool, and I am absolutely in love with is here now. we have been here about two and a half weeks and we have only spent time together once. All she cares about is her sorority. And when we did hang out all she did was talk about how she was   tired of dealing with it.   Why doesn't she quit?  What is her obsession with being a part of something?  I just wish that we were growing closer like we thought we would in college. Instead we are moving further and further apart. Every guy she meets ends up asking her out on a date. She always some how avoids it, and I don't know why. Suddenly, a guy with plans for a very successful career seems much more attarctive than just a regular guy that wants to have fun and hang out. I can't believe i just wrote that because I am one of those guys with plans for a successful career. Maybe thats not what she is looking for at all. She lives seven floors below me but instead of coming up to say hi, she just calls. We talk two or three times a day, and when we see eachother we always give eachother subtle compliments. She is the one person who can always make me laugh no matter what kind of mood I'm in. I guess thats what being best friends for five years will do to you. I never knew I thought about her as much as I do. I think I'll go and see "
"Right now I am sitting in my dorm room thinking about how much reading I have to finish tonight. I am listening to the radio as I write this. Jessica Simpson is what I am listening to. I am also thinking about how many typing errors I make as I type. I am drinking Pink Lemonade and chewing Orbit gum. I am also thinking about my boyfriend, and waiting for either an email or a phone call from Kuwait. I am very worried about him, but he reassures me everyday that he will be ok. I have to read a lot of Biology tonight. I also have to get my clothes together for tomorrow morning. Tomorrow is the start of my first full week as a college student. I don't like college to much, it is quite boring and time consuming. I would prefer to be going to college closer to home or at home, but here is where I find myself. Oh well, it's okay. I'm testing the waters and seeing how I like this place. So far so good, the football games are fun and my classes are interesting. Except for one of my Biology classes, my professor is evil. I wish that my boyfriend would call, I would really like to talk to him. I miss him so much, and I can't wait till he comes home. I have lots of pictures of my family and boyfriend in my room. They are all over, I miss them all so much. I hate being this far from them, but I have to do what I have to do. I am full from eating a giant burrito at Freebirds about an hour ago. I keep staring at my cell phone hoping someone will call me. I still have to do some Pre Calculus homework and read for Psychology too. I received one Instant Message, I wonder who it was from. Probably my little cousin who bothers me all the time. Everytime someone signs on and off the internet that annoying door sound plays. It gets on my nerves. I wish it was Saturday still, I had fun on Saturday. I am tired of typing and I want to start my reading so I can go to bed. My roommate is going to Jack n the Box, and she asked if I wanted anything, but I do not like burgers or greasy food anymore. Plus I am watching my figure and do not want to get the dreaded Freshman 15!"" I just got an email but I can't read it until this is over I want to read it so bad because it might be from my boyfriend. Dang I so wish that I could check my email, with my luck it probably was my boyfriend. My music stopped and no it is silent in my room but I can hear some music from my RA's room. I think her roommate is playing the music. It sounds funny from here but oh well. I'm really tired from staying up so late of Friday night, but I guess that's what I get. This gum is already starting to lose flavor and I just barely put it in my mouth. Yuck! Blah! I got new sunglasses this weekend. I like them a lot. I got to shop some this weekend, and I bought more food for my room. I didn't need any of it, but it was definitely a spur of the moment type thing. I really need to read my Biology so I can read my Psychology so that I can take a shower and go to bed. It's only been 13 minutes since I began typing and I feel like I have been typing forever. I am worried about my Biology class and I hope I do good. I don't want to let anyone back home down. I want to be able to prove my ex friend wrong that I can be on my own, since she was to chicken to leave home. But I don't like her anyways, she has an obsession with thinking my world revolves around her, when obviously hers revolves around me. I don't know if that made sense, but I don't really care. Only five more minutes left and I am running out of things to write about. I got another email and now I am pretty sure it is my boyfriend. This is the longest 5 minutes of my life. I also have never made this many mistakes when I type. Oh well. I want to run downstairs and get myself some snacks. I wish I could go get some right now but I have to finish writing. I realize that I can't wait to get something over with and then when I start it I don't really feel like finishing it. Oh well, only a little bit more time left. Then I can cross this off my to-do list for the week. I miss my boyfriend so much, I cannot wait till he comes home. I get to go home next month! YAY! I can't wait to see my family and my puppy! I am thinking about all the times I had when I was at home. I had a sense of security there, I am very family oriented and I miss them a lot. Only 30 seconds left. And then I have more to do tonight. I have so much to do in so little time. Time to get it all done so I'm not swamped this week. "
"     The room seems to be nice and cool, much better than the heat outside. I should keep in mind that in thirty minutes or so I will go to a study group. I'm kind of hungry, i don't know what I should get for dinner today. Should I go for sushi or pasta, why am I so indecisive?  I wonder what my friends are doing right now. I hate it when I don't know what to write, or when I have a blank moment. I should remember to check if there are any conflicting exam times with my biology class exam. What is it that makes people tick?  As soon as I find the time to, I'm going to read Lord of The Rings. Maybe i shouldn't get sushi because its too expensive, but its also so good. There goes my indecisiveness again. I wonder which song I should listen to next, what am I in the mood for. This song sounds good, I guess I'll stick with this one for a while until I get bored of it. Is there any other homework left, I hate it whenever I get the feeling that I'm forgetting something but can't seem to find out what. It might be a good idea to do laundry this weekend, but i'll probably get lazy again, must remind myself not to be lazy. Maybe I should call my study partner that I might be late in coming because of thi essay. I'll turn around for a while and see what my roommate is watching on TV. I wonder if the music that I'm playing bugs my roommate or not. The TV show thats on right now seems pretty funny. I've never had Mountain Dew: Code Red before, maybe I should try it sometime, that is as soon as they restock the coke machines in my dorm. What is the point of life? All we do is try to become someone who has a purpose in society, and then in the end it doesn't even matter cause we all eventually die. I wonder what it would be like if I could be immortal. Many seems to think that being immortal is a curse cause you'll go through a lot of pain and it'll never end, I on the other hand find it interesting. I hope I can get a high GPA and keep it, it would really be nice if something academic turned out perfectly the way I wanted it to. I still kind of mad at the chemistry online homework, how could I be so stupid as to make such stupid mistakes. Oh well I can make it up on the next homework. I better do good on the exam, cause this is supposed to be easy for me since I've done it all already.   "
"Im feeling a little stress coming on now, because Im think about everything  I have to do, but have yet to start it. sometimes I can't resist going out with  friends and that is really bad, because then I don't have time to study. I  don't know what else Im feeling right now. Im just sitting in front of a  computer in the pcl and typing along. even though the paper doesn't not need correct spelling and stuff, I still go back and correct it(I guess cause it's a  habit). right now Im observing people as they walk by. I really enjoy this  assignment, because it helps me to put all my thoughts and feelings on paper,  instead of holding them in ( as what I normally do)  I generally don't like to  tell people my feelings inside, I guess cause Im very paranoid and I don't  trust others with my personal secrets, even if they were really close friends  of mine. I can't wait until later(6:00p. m. when I go practice my throwing of  footballs. Im really excited about intramural football. most of the people  on my team are really nice. Im just a little scared about the real games b/c  Im afraid that the guys on the other coed Im teams will run into me and hurt  me. I was really sore this morning, after I woke up b/c of football practice  yesterday morning. football practice was pretty fun. I enjoy going through  all the drills and practices. at first I wasn't too sure about playing Im  football, but when one of my friends asked me to join her team I was like sure. our team makeup is kinda funny. we have all upperclassmen guys and mainly freshman girls. I just thought that was kinda interesting. well, Im looking  at the clock and it seems like I have five more minutes of writing time. right after I do this assignment, Im going to go study on the fourth floor. I really don't want to be left behind in my classes. I already am and that's  not a good way to start off my college years. in high school I studied  constantly and now I rarely get to study b/c there is so much stuff going on  and I usually give in to my friends when they want to go do something. I  think time really does fly by. before I know it, it's time to go to sleep again I wish I had nothing to worry about. I always wondered what my life would be like  if I was rich. it would be much more relaxing I think. well, it's already been  twenty minutes and I would write longer, but I really have got to go studying. I can't wait until I get to write paper 2, because I have a lot to say about my  college experience so far. "
"I am feeling anxious about my philosophy class that I have in 40 minutes. the class in which I have not attended yet due to a schedule change. I hope they haven't been assigned a large amount of work yet so that I won't have too much catching up to do. I hope that there isn't going to be an exam on one of the days I'm going to be out of town. I've already had to email professor pennebaker about missing an exam because I will be out of town for my sister's wedding. I wonder what it will be like for my sister after she is married. I hope everything works out for her. I wonder if the person I marry I already know, or if I have yet to meet them. I need to figure out where and how to pay for the classes I added/dropped, I need to do this soon. I hope that when I have to connect flights in st. louis it all goes well and is easy, since I've never had to connect before. it will be worth it though because I'll get to see my sister who I haven't seen in a very long time. I need to go to the rowing meeting tonight, but I'm afraid if I commit to it I won't have enough time to study. also, I'm going to miss 5 days of tryouts because I'll be out of town. it sure seems like going out of town is causing me to miss a lot of things, but my sister is important to me and being a part of her wedding will be very special. I need to go do some reading for my rhetoric class before I have to leave for philosophy. I hope I like this class, or else I switched out of sociology for nothing. "
"Right now, I am very busy. I am very preoccupied by trying to balance my academic studies with my social life. Joining a fraternity is a very difficult thing to do, as it entails choosing a group of people who are most like you, in that they share common ideals and interests. Outside of my world at the University of Texas, I am also struglling to maintain a long distance relationship with the woman who could possibly grow to become my wife. She attends the University of Alabama, and she is also an incoming freshman. However, my troubles are very different than hers. Yes, she joined a serority, but the Greek process that involves women is wholly differnt than the one concerning men. But what is important is that she has already become an active member of a serority, a serority in which she already grown a liking to many active members. I, on the other hand, have just begun my process of joining a fraternity, and is not only stressful but very intimidating. In my opinion, older men are simply more imtimidating and less likely to accept new members than older women. This process of distancing ourselves from each other and the process pf maing new friends, indpendenet of one another, has taken its toll on the quality of our relationship. We often argue, our telephone conversations are usually brief and superficial, and we lack a common ground on which to converse. I am worried than our relationship will not withstand the tests of time and distance, which is the most bothersome thing of all. My feelings for her are still intense, yet they no longer stand forefront in my mind. Now, I have other academic as well as social predicaments to fill uo my time. I worry that she is experiencing the same phenomenon. In addition, I am thinking of how alone I feel in this problem. My roomate does share a similar experience, and I can subsequently not look to him for guidance or advice. I don't want my feelings tp change towards Christel, but I fear that they will, and we will eventually encounter a mutual break-up, but one after which we cannot remain friends. Digressing on a tangent, I can stare out my window as I type this essay, a look out onto the hiils of Austin. Coming from Dallas, I have grown to appreciate Austin's attractive landscape. It hills, its sunsets, and other natural phenomenons sometimes offer a sense of peace during such a hectic time. My roomate is always creating some kind of noise. As I sit here and try to complete this assignment, he is playing a game of football on the Sony Playstation. Does he not have homework to do?  I don't know, I guess that it bothers me sometimes that I feel and seem so busy when those around me seem carefree and happy. Will I ever feel completely happy again? In the near future?  It's not that I'm depressed or willing to let go of Christel to free myself of these ""troubles,"" it's just that I want all the things that trouble me to merge into one moment of happiness, during whcih all things just ""click together. ""  Too optimistic, I know. That'slife, I know, but I can still wish that things could be different. I never tyhought I'd say this, butit feels good to attack this assignment. In a sense, it's profoundly fulfilling to articulate your troubles as you feel them. I guess sometimes it's easier to realize the way you feel when you struggle to put it into words. But, I've still got troubles. God, I sound depressed, but the fact of the matter is that I am actually having a pretty good time. I have made friends, and I relaize that, given time, all of my problems will work themselves out. I truly believe that unhappiness is a temporary sentiment, as happiness is the underlying emotion in every situation. Damn, I've got to wake up early tomorrow. I wish it was like that, but, as most people would say, that's life!  My twenty minutes is almost up, and I really feel better for having articulated some of unshared and unresoved conflicts.  "
"*****Why does this keep going to the left instead of down a space at the end of each line Prof. Pennebaker?????************* As I sit in this library, I can't help but notice the pleasure I get from the quietness. It is the same feeling I get from sitting in a park or on a golfcourse. Perhaps even in a bookstore. The quietness provides my mind with an escape from the everyday world of horns, traffic jams, and yelling. From this feeling, my mind seems to work on a smoother track, with less obstacles to overcome before I can finish a complete thought. If the world was in a complete silence at all times, or perhaps even if I were deaf, I believe I would be wiser and would be able to formulate thoughts easier. Does this mean that deaf people actually have an easier time getting by in the world? Or is their inability to communicate too much of a burden. Maybe this is what's wrong with todays world. Communication lines are so mixed up due to language barriers and different types of slang that the world is like one large deaf fishbowl. In that case, deaf people WOULD have an easier everyday life because they would be minus the struggles we all go through with communication. If communication were an easy things, and we all saw eye-to-eye on all issues, achieving things such as world peace, business agreements, and compromises would be no big deal. Where did the communication lines go wrong? Why did humanity branch out into hundreds of different languages and tongues when one universal language could have eliminated so many problems. The answer to that will most likely never be found. This girl sitting to my right is awfully attractive, but I can't muscle up the courage to talk to her. Is it once again the problem of communication, or does this have to do purely with a lack of courage. I would like to think it is a communication problem, but that would probably be just a lame excuse for not talking to her. Of course it is a lack of courage. Although I know she won't bite my head off, slap me, ignore me, or flat out dis me, I still am too much of a coward to begin a conversation with her. What if she knew what I was thinking right now. Would she be flattered, embarrassed, insulted, or just flat out shocked? I guess I'll never know, unless I ask her. We both know that isn't going to happen because we've already established that I'm acting like a coward right now. No big deal, there are plenty of fish in the sea. Wow! I can't believe how fast twenty minutes just went. Writing without structure is a lot more enjoyable then writing with it, and as they say: Time flies when you're having fun! "
"This is a little confusing. I am not quite sure what I ahould be doing. Oh well I guess it really doesn't matter. I am glad I am going home this weekend. I really miss everyone. It will cool to just hang out at home and not have to worry about what I should be doing right now. College is a lot of reading. I am actually learning a lot more than I learned in a whole semester of high school. I enjoy that but it does get to be a bit tedious, expecially science. Well iguess it can only get better form here on. I was confused about a lot of stuff, like what to do with all of my spare time. I was going to have a job but then they took away my work study and now I have too much free time. That's okay because I didn't really want to work anyway. But I can't believe the lady never called be back. Tha t is just rude etiquette. Oh well. There's nothing I can do about it anyway. I wonder why we are shunned by our dorm mates. I guess we weren't social enough or something. We tried. But at least they aren't outright mean to us, they are just very cordial and you know what that means. Doh!  Oh well. It's fun rooming with Ashley, I just don't know why she chooses to bother me on purpose sometimes. I think she can be very immature at times. But I would rather put up with that than with someone who barely talks or just doesn't like me for whatever reason. I don't want to go to all those meetings tonight that sucks!  Maybe I just won't go. But I probably will. I can't shirk my responsibilites just because I don't want to. Maybe some people need to do that once in a while though. I wonder what Plato would have to say about that. His books are cool. I like the idea of Socrates just sitting around waiting to confuse people. If you make people question their own values, then what do you consider as your values?  I don't know. LThat's just odd. "
"I am sitting here in my dorm room trying to organize my time for the rest of the day and night. I have a lot of reading to catch up on. I have trouble sitting down reading for a long period of time. I would rather sit in a lecture and listen to a professor. That is, if he/she is interesting. I want to read and understand my psychology book, but for some reason I haven't been able to concentrate on it. I feel like I am behind in this class for some reason. My mom graduated with a degree in psychology. She loved it. My biology class is my favorite. My professor is interesting and the book is interesting to me too. I wish I knew what I wanted to be. I have so many different ideas and I can't decide right now. I talked to my mom today and she suggested marine biology because she knew I used to be interested in that. She also suggested being a doctor. I don't know if I can go to school for 8 more years though. Four more years seems like a lot to me. But I know I will do it. I just feel weird right now I guess because I am just starting. I am 3 and a half hours away from home. I like it here but I miss it there. I always have a lot on my mind and I think that is why it has been hard to concentrate on reading lately. Eight months ago, 2 days before Christmas, my boyfriend of 3 years, Phillip, was killed in a car accident. I almost didn't come to UT because he was supposed to follow me here and live in Austin too so we could be together. I thought about that a lot the first week I was here. It is just really hard. This is one of the reasons I am being in my reading for philosophy and psychology. I've been doing homework all week making up for last week. When it comes to school work I love being ahead. Which is why I am doing this writing assignment a week in advance. I'm hoping that I will feel better when I finish this and I will be able to read 2 chapters and comprehend it. When I stay ahead in school I always feel so much better. I like to read the sections before lectures rather than after. I am the type of person that takes on big load and I tend to get stressed out easy that way. I decided that when I came here I was strictly going to concentrate on school. In high school I had a full schedule of ap classes, a job, and participated in athletics. I loved all of it but I decided I need a break from every thing else which is why I'm not working this semester. I worked 6 days a week this past summer to save up for spending money this year so that I would not have to worry about working. My parents are paying for my school and all my bills, even my gas so I don't ever want to ask them for spending money. I received some scholarship money from Dobie, UT from my home town. We have community scholarship that they give out every year. There was a scholarship made in Phillips name this year. I got that one. That made me feel good I guess. I like being here but it is just really weird. I hope I adjust to Austin soon. I already like it a lot better than when I first move here 2 weeks ago. My best friend Stephanie helped me move down here and it was hard when she had to go back home, but I am going to see here this weekend so that makes me happy "
"    I am so nervous about what I got on my economics test. I know that I spent a long time studying, but I will be very upset if I don't get at least a B. I can't wait till next weekend when I get to go to Lubbock to visit Ryan. I hope that the Chili Cookoff will be fun. It sounds like it will be entertaining. I am upset that I am not going to get to Sara, though. I wish I could go to Lubbuck this weekend, but I have two tests on Monday. I am so stressed out about those test. I am going to spend a lot of this weekend studying. After I get those test out of the way I need to spend a lot of time on my english paper. I feel like I can never get caught up. I am looking forward to the Phi Psi mixer tongiht. I hope that I can meet some really nice guys. Actually, I don't care if I meet nice guys or not, I am just looking forward towards getting to go out. Lately I feel like all I ever do is study. College is so much more stressful than high school because you don't know what to expect. I am not sure if I am studying enough. At least I will be able to tell after I receive my grades from all of these tests. I am so tired. I wish I could take a nap. Hopefully after class I will have time to eat, workout, and take a nap. I am really upset that I haven't had much time to work out lately. When I was in high school I had cheerleading practice everyday. I was always working out. Now the only thing my body is use to is walking around to all my classes. It makes me feel so out of shape. Britany Spears is the best. I am listening to her CD right now. I had so much fun at her concert. It was weird to actually see her in person. I am so glad that I have been understanding my Calculus lately. At first I was worried that I was going to have to drop the class. I am glad that I decided to stick with it, because now it isn't so bad. The only part that sucks is the homework. It takes forever to do because the questions are so tedious. I am really nervous about completeing the test in 50 minutes. I can barely do one problem in 20. Hopefully they won't be as hard as the homework problems. I am praying that they are a lot more general. I hope that Ryan and I have time to talk tonight. It seems like I am always busy with Zeta new member functions and he is always busy with his rush stuff. It will be  a good thing for me to be able to see him. I need to figure out which airport to fly out of. I hope the planes aren't really full, or else I won't be able to go because I fly stand by. I hate flying stand by. It is such a pain. You have to arrive at the airport at least two hours before your plane even departs. I don't know why I am complaining. It is a lot better to fly than to drive. Once I drove to Lubbock from my hometown, Colleyville. It seemed never ending. Plus the scenery was not very visually pleasing. At least I was riding with Sara, my best friend. We kept each other occupied. That was so funny when we both started singing that one song. We could not stop laughing. Another reason I don't like driving is because it takes up time that I could be doing other things. At least when I fly I can read, do homework or even sleep. When  I am driving I have to concentrate the whole time. I need to go over to the business school today before five. I need to change my passion panel registration times. I am so frustrated with that whole system. I wish I could just get in the ones I wanted. "
"     So, i'm like, I have NO idea what to write in a stream of consciousness for 20 consecutive minutes. So, I guess, I'll just start off with a recap of the week. Nothing. You've got these 15 minute classes (woo-hoo), then a whole day afterwards to blow. That goes on for a few more days, then. Hey hey!  A three day weekend. Blah, like I really have much of a life to actually spend those 3 days having much fun. But, it was a break, nonetheless. The last break I'll ever see in my given lifetime. Well, I headed home. That was the plan. Head home, leech off the folks one last time for a while, then I'd get back to my   studying  . Well, suffice to say, I'm back, and I guess you could genuinely call this   studying  . &lt;Changing mp3&gt;    same auld lang syne  . What an awesome slow song. Mellow. Sad. Right, so. I'm boring you. A computer. A simple man-made machine apt in dealing with 90% of my socializing. THANK YOU AIM. I've got stupid art history to read up for. Thirty something pages I do believe. God, I hate being sick. Just my brilliant luck, I get home, and the sniffles begin. Then a drippy nose. Then the stoppage. Ugh, Vicks is my new best friend. This song is making me sad. i got to sne3eze. *whew*  Violent. Gosh, I hope i can succeed in college. Off to a pretty bad start. Me, uncertain of what major I'd stay in. Writer's block sets in, here. The song's almost over. Hehe, It's kind of funny to think about. Ever since I got here, all i did was sit in front of this computer and downloaded away at my heart's content. I got movies, I got Jap Crap (the beloved japanese anime), and i got music. Did you know my music collection is about 2 Gigs right now?  I've got another gig stored away on CD. Hah, I'm such a loser. My self-defeatist attitude can't be good for me, but it helps me get a laugh. You know, it really pisses me off when people have no sense of humor. &lt;song change, brb&gt;  Another slow, mellow piece, by Jim Brickman. He's an awesome pianist. I like to play the piano alot. When *secretly* i do it to please people. Wahaha. My (un-)superior piano skills gets all the chicks. Don't i wish. It's not like I'm that good either. I had what, 9 years of classical training (which by the ways sounds pretty good on a transcript), but it's not like the teacher was all that great. Grr, I really hated her. She made piano the mainstay of what I should be doing. She really didn't care if I intonated that I had some project due the next day. I had to sit through stupid hour-long lessions, only to come home all feeling defeated. God. It's not like I ever really   practiced   either :). I lied a bunch when filling out practice charts. It's like:   Oh, yeah. I really DID play those 50 minutes every day.   What total BS :). Oh, Am I supposed to curse?  Can I curse?  I swear to myself everyday not to do it, but it's really starting to creep into my vocabulary. hah, I've been typing so long, and constant, I bet my roommate is wondering   What on EARTH could this guy be typing for that long anyways?    Hehe, oh well, he's cool, not much to worry about. Man, I was worried all weekend that strangers I didn't know would pervade through the room and take my stuff. I'm paranoid that way you know?  Some unfortunate event from the past always haunts me. Stupid burglars. They stole my stuff. I've been scared since. That's a story I tell everyone. Man, I have some major psychological problems. Hope this class sheds some light. You know, ever since I took Psych in senior year, I've had this very strong fascination towards this field. Heck, if I stayed on this course, I could become a doctor!  Study interesting stuff, AND get lots o MONEY!  But, I guess, I shouldn't let my ambitions get too far ahead of other pressing matters. Sixteen minutes and 30 seconds past. This assignment goes by pretty quick. This is really fun. You know, sometimes I really DO do this. Sit down, and just talk and rant about nothing for an extended period of time. It's fun. it's enlightening. Sometimes it's downright hilarious the things i write down. Hmm, I wish I were funnier. My friend Jonathan has the best wit you'll ever see. Awesome with satire and sarcasm, he's the best guy to turn to for a laugh. Hah, just thinking about our antics I crack a smile. Oh boy!  an IM message. Too bad I can't answer it. Ok, well, i'll take a peek. Hey, we're playing basketball at gregory. I'm still feeling sick. I wonder if it's wise or not. I could just walk on the track some. I really don't feel like running around, aggrivating my sore throat. Ok, ten seconds left. Make the most of it. Hah, cya later.     Sweeeeet!  I can still write after the 2o minutes. But I guess that they'll only grade the first part. Ahh, this assignment has really brightened my day. Fun as heck. Well, I'm out. Later. "
"This is a stream of consciousness paper for my psych. class. That is the only class I actually enjoy going to. They have about a katrillion people in that class and it is freezing cold, but that's okay. Almost all my classes except for English have 456,897,456,789 people in it. There is a cute guy in almost every single one of my classes, or if not in class, on the way to it. That's what college is all about. That's why I came from Louisiana to Texas. New people. It's so different out here. I love my roommates. They are so cute, and have really cute friends. I have one that is my favorite though. That's Gibby. He's so cute. anyway Lisa is so mad that the damn computer won't work. I believe that is a direct quote. She want to go call Adam, her lifeguard lover. Sometimes I think she's jealous because I found my little Gilbert within 5 days of coming to the great state of Texas. At first I didn't like it here, but now I love it. I know 345,231,859,635 guys, and about 4 girls. Today I got to go with Brady, our fine neighbor to go wash his Rodeo. I got to vacuum. It was great. I love him. But not as much as I (secretly) love room 1432.  The bus rides have been hell, but we ride with the neighbors. I hate to stand up. I hate that almost as much as I hate not sitting on the end of a row in class. I think it's the extra elbow room that I get. I hate those desks too. I am used to having about 565 sq. feet of desk area. Oh well. Anyway, yesterday, I bought Gibby some boxer shorts. I gave the salesman a hard time because I didn't know any of his sizes. oh, well. I don't want  to limit myself so soon after coming to Texas. I want someone to play with, but I also want some time to explore the great wide dating field. There is a nasty rumor going around the apartment saying that Marc likes me. I think Marc is an awesome guy, but I don't know how willing I am to give Gibby up. It has gotten to the point where everyone asks me where Gilbert is, and what he's doing. Okay, I may talk to the boy but I don't know every single blessed move he makes. Now as for Dark Chad across the street I would like to know. He is so cute and artsy and he is an avid fan of party girl. okay I think my time is up, so Ill say good bye till tomorrow. Thank you, Simone Theriot "
"  Well, I think that I need to practice working on my team games more. My teammates and I have very little coordination amongst ourselves, we always just end up doing things individually instead of as a team. Zendt usually ends up spamming huntresses by himself in a corner, Travis makes a few footman and then techs to knights, which usually then get killed, and I try to scout or tech myself. Their is no over-arching strategy to our game, which is the problem. In a one-on-one game, I only have to be concerned with what I am doing and making, and only what my single enemy is doing or making. I have decided to dub the name of our team   Team Suck  , because we are that terrible. Oh well, I can still tower rush the newbs on battle. net any day.      Amazingly enough, I don't have a lot of work to do tonight, aside from this assignment I'm doing right now so that I can go ahead and have it out of the way. Hopefully, I won't have any work to do this weekend when the fam comes to visit. And even if I do, I will just do as much as I can on Sunday night instead of burdening myself with it while they are here. It's not that I don't have a work ethic, it's just that I prioritize doing things with them above reading out of a textbook, which I will be doing all the time while I am here at UT. They are only going to be around for a few days, and then I may not see them again until the next break.     I wonder when it will start getting cold around here, I brought my jacket, but I shouldn't need it until October or so I believe. My bathroom is quite the feces-infested cesspool right now, I should probably do something about that. It's beginning to get kind of nauseating, but perhaps if I can out-last the guy next door, he will do it before I do. Pretty sick, I know, but I did it when I first got here and I'll be damned if I get to do it every time. I should also vacuum the room, that is getting pretty disgusting as well. Crumbs and such will attract all kinds of vermin eventually. I wonder how often (if ever) they spray for bugs around here. A couple of times I've gone into the bathroom and found one in the tub or on the floor. One time I actually stepped on one before I knew what it was in the dark. That was quite nasty.     There Zendt goes, IMing me while I'm doing my writing assignment. must not answer it. must continue my non-sequitious train of thought. i wonder if I spelled non-sequitious correctly. If i spent a few seconds checking it on dictionary. com it shouldn't cut into my writing. aw screw it, who cares if the prof or TA or whoever reads this thinks im an illiterate boob. I don't think they are checking on spelling anyway. I bet there are other stream of consciousness writings by students who have trouble writing in english because they are from other countries, so why should I care if i have a few typos. I could pretend I'm a foreigner from Germany or some crap, even if it did matter. Except now I've written it in here, so they would have incriminating evidence. Wow, this is too much digression into an idiotic train of thought. Must think of something else to type about. . . . . .     Um, i think I'm losing my focus a little now. man, my nails are dirty, look at that. That charcoal I've been using is a damn mess. I hope that we don't do too many more charcoal drawings now. Those blind contour drawings are so much cleaner.  I wonder if they will egver get more cups in the kitchen. I am getting pretty effin' sick of bringing my own cup to dinner. that is pure bovine-cacka. I wonder if they care about me typing cuss words in here. better not do it just to be on the safe side. Must try to maintain some false sense of professionalism. time. is. almost. . . up. . . . . NOW "
"As I sit here at my desk typing, all I can think about is how hot I am and how come our room is so unbelievably hot. I am under a lot of stress right now because I have so many pages to read and it takes me so long to read them since I have trouble focusing on them. By body is starting to sweat, maybe I should tell my RA to turn down the AC. I am really stressing over having to read biology, because, no matter how much I read it, I just can't comprehend what the book is saying. I'm sure I will struggle in biology this year. At first, I couldn't understand why you are making us do this, but now that I am doing this I understand the purpose behind it. This is really helping me to gather my thoughts and it is actually nice to express your feelings. My stomach feels extremely full because I just came from the Dobie cafeteria. I really wish I hadn't eaten so much junk food, I need to eat healthier. I am really regretting eating that ice cream, I have got to stop doing that. I also need to work out more. It all of a sudden just occurred to me that the reason I am so hot is because I am sunburned. When you're sunburned does your body just start letting of hot air or something? It is obviously clear that I am unfamiliar with the way my body works. I am dreading class tomorrow because I am so behind on my reading. I probably should be doing reading instead of doing this. Its funny how you find yourself doing anything just for the sake of avoiding the things you don't want to do. I only have to write for a few more minutes. I wonder what my test is going to be like in biology. If I take great notes and read, even if I don't comprehend it very well, will I still be able to do well on the tests? My elbow has just started throbbing because I scraped it water skiing earlier today. I really wish I wouldn't have fallen because it starts throbbing every time I extend my elbow. Oh great! Time's up. Talk to you later. katie "
"     I know I said that I was ready to write but Im not too sure exactly what I need to be doing. I hope this is right. Great now Im worrying. I worry way too much that is a problem of mine. I always seem to worry even if there is no reason for it I even worry about other people's problems. I wish I could just be laid back sometimes like my best friend Joseph. He's also my roommate. Now Im now sure if this is right because Im telling you about myself when Im just supposed to be thinking. Okay now Im thinking. Why is my room so hot. Sometimes its not hot but right now Im boiling. I think it is because I am nervous about this assignment. Theres no reason to be I just need to type. Well here I am typing. My room smells funny right now. Joseph bought some cinna sticks from Dominoes a while back and I think that they are going bvad. I know they are going bad. I need to take out the trash than. I hate that I get lazy and don't take out the trash because it makes me feel and llok like a slob. Great now I propbably sound all anal about mess when Im not at all like that. Well im not a messy person but you know. Gosh reading over this I sound like such a pessimist and so boring. Oh well. Time sure is going by pretty slow. I want to make jell-o but I don't think I have room in fridge for it. Gosh some lime jell-o would be pretty good right now. I wonder how jell-o becomes jell-o . Like how does it form the way it does? Whats in gelatin to make it stiffen up and turn into jell-o. One day Im going to find out. More than likely I won't do it but it seems reassuring to tell myself that Im gooing to look into it. It makes me feel productive. Im worried about my financial situation right now. I still have almost 4000 to pay off and I got a loan for that and all but I don't know where that money is or who I need to talk to in order to get my hands on it. Tomorrow I guess Ill just need to go to the ssb and talk to someone about that. I can't think of anything else right now. I feel like Im just waisting time typing nothjing but if this ios what was wanted than who am I to say no. This should be an easy   a   or at least I hope. I hope the instructor doesnt read this and just because I said easy A then Im going to get like a   b   or something. Just in case Im sorry even if this seems easy I do my work and I dedicate time so when it comes down to it, I think I deserve that   a  . Great Im already negotiating for my grade and the instructor hasnt even seen this assignment. I wonder if this class will ever offer extra credit if ever im in need of some assistance? I doubt it especially if most of my high school teachers would just laugh if the subject was brought up. But then again a lot of those teachers had massive egos even though some of them had readon to have them. Ironically the teacher who had the most reason to have an ego was the most down to earth and lenient. Is lenient even a word? Oh well anyhow the teacher, her name was Ms. Ng, she scored perfect on her SAT's. How the heck did she ever pull that off. And since she did I have no idea why shes teaching at Edison. In case you dopnt know which you probably don't Edison is a public inner-city school in San Antonio and it does not have the best of reputations. I hate that though because any time your talking to someone important and you think your sounding intelligent and going somewhere with your conversation they would always seem to ask what school do you go to? And that great conversation just plummets to hell when you respond   Edison  . Esdpecially with teen-agers who think they are too good to even know of someone from Edison. Well thats their loss because Im a great person to know and I don't fit the   Edison   stereotype. There should be no stereotypes. They are just not fair. Hey cool ranting on and on made the time go by fast and its almost up. just 35 more seconds. 30 now. Wow this is actually good stress relief I should do this more often when I have time. "
"camping was fun. got a little too drunk. I think I'm getting sick though. sore throat, headache, the usual routine. no worries. I hope I can be as happy as those people we camped with. even though they were kinda old they were still really cool. and they were partiers. it's wierd to think that peopole so different in age can totally relate to each other. I thought it was going to be a boring weekend but I think I actually learned a lot. I hope that when I'm that old I can still appreciate life as much as they do. they were just so gracious for everything they had even if it wasn't a kings life. and that one guy was the shit. I can't imagine being shot out of a cannon. he must have some great stories. I hope I can see dustin tonight. that would be bad ass. but I would really really like to see a sunset too. I'm definatley lacking in the sunset category. but I don't think the ones here will be nearly as good as el paso. damn I miss el paso. I miss the desert. I could go for laying in the bed of a pickup truck and watching the stars while listening to good music. maybe some live acoustic shit. bongos and guitars. that's the shit. I love gummy bears. the white ones are the best. but the other day we got a really weird one. it was big and gflat and tasted fujnny. but it was good. it was so good that we even split it between three people. so d'lane and I met this guy deniz. I don't know about him.     I have hella ant bites. they suck. all ants should die. a painful, painful death. I need to paint my toenails. that will be fun. I love my new fish clarence. he's so cool!  but he's a very deepo sleeper and he likes to play dead a lot just to mess with my mind. I hate fish!  but for some weird reason I really like that guy. but I miss my kitty a lot. that's a bummer. well I think it's been 20 minutes. "
"I don't understand how it is I'm supposed to write this thing when I can't even type as fast as I can think. it's crazy because right now at this moment I am under pressure to think. at the same time I am trying to spell every thing correctly because I am a horrible speller. I have trouble with double letters in words. for instance tomorrow. is that right?  it's funny that someone who is supposed to be smart. I hate when people call me smart because I don't feel it. it's even wrong to say that I just work hard because I really don't. I was one of those loser high school kids that never studied and was only interested in class if there was some hard core discussion happening. my teachers never knew and neither did my parents because they always assumed I was studying hard. well they piss me off because they or rather my dad kicked me out because of stupid crap. I think it was because I never talked to them I hated talking to them. they were so bluh. I mean I talked about sports and politics and crap with my dad. but never anything serious that involved me. and my step mom lied to me about most of her life. telling me that she was so sweet and innocent as a young person but she actually had like 3 abortions and now she can't have kids. then when I got kicked out she tried to be all nice and stuff to me. people never I'M me and now that I am trying to write this thing everyone wants to talk to me. that's like when you are on the phone talking to someone you haven't talked to in a while all your friends start to call you or when you run out of minutes. I think it's a rip off to society how these stupid phone companies and internet providers make us pay. last month I had to pay $117 on that stupid cell phone. I didn't even realize I had talked that much on the thing. now I have lost my train of thought and have no idea what to write. can I cuss on this thing. I don't want to sound dumb or uneducated (which actually to some degree I'm not and early I did say I wasn't smart) does that make me crazy. I wonder if I can type stuff in another language. say for instance people who's first language isn't english like my boyfriend. I think he thinks in portuguese and then translates everything to english or maybe not I do that for spanish when I am trying to understand people but I can't speak it for the life of me but I can somewhat write it. and I normally understand it too. but I really want to learn it big time for when I become a doctor. I want to be a teacher too but I'm afraid because I'm like super mean and right now my hands are tired from writing and I really hate the fact that I keep up with my chemistry and this homework, but my pre-cal I dread. maybe because that loser assigned 80 discouraging problems. they are supposed to be really easy but the way he teaches confuses me and it really ticks me off. I think I'm just not going to go to class and just do the work on my own and ask my really smart friends who are in calculus right now if I run into a problem. but how hard can it be I took that crap in high school but I forgot it all because I never went for understanding just for the right answer. I am developing absolutely horrid study, sleeping, and everything else habits here. I don't even clean as often as I used to. I just want to be lazy and go out. I mean I never got to do that stuff when I was home because I dad was super strict. I never even got in trouble at school. not that that is to be rewarded because you're supposed to behave in school and make good grades. which I did. but I had a job and participated in sports and did well in them too. but my dad wanted too much he wanted me to be perfect and to not make mistakes. I'm not just exaggerating either. my grandparents not even his own mother understand why he did what he did. and he has explained why he kicked me out. it sucks because I have to pay for everything when I thought I had everything. sometimes life sucks big time but I'm not about to complain anymore because I'm still here and my grandparents are helping me and I am trying to help myself but I just get so tired sometimes. I want to keep writing but I'm supposed to do my pre-cal so I can go to target with heather at like five to spend money I don't have. "
"I had to wait until today to do this assignment because every time I wanted to do it or remembered to do it, my boyfriend Michael was in the room. I didn't feel like I could do a true stream of consciousness assignment if I knew that he was going to look over my shoulder at any second. I guess I knew that my mind was on other things besides him at the time; stuff that I didn't want him to know about. He would kill me. Not in the literal sense of course but in any case, he would be destroyed. If I told him what I was thinking it would be the end. I don't want it to be the end. I'm not saying I don't want it to (I've got mail, and I really want to check it, but I'm going to keep typing) go on forever, but I love him enormously and if I told him that while he was gone for an evening I slept in another guy's bed and we ended up fooling around. that would obviously not be exactly great for my relationship with Michael. I've always been big on honesty, but why can't I bring myself to tell him the truth about what happened between Damian and I? Maybe because he'd ask why and I'd say that I'm not even really sure why. That's a big problem with our conversations. If he asks me why or what's wrong (he says ""what?"" a LOT) I can't ever give him a straight answer because if there is something wrong then I usually can't pinpoint it enough to describe it and if I attempt to describe it, then it usually comes out sounding wrong and then he'll bring it up later because he's like an elephant. he never forgets. So I'm still trying to figure out why? Maybe I needed something exciting. I've known Michael for years and we've been dating for over 8 months. I was never really physically attracted to him, but only later I was because I loved him. The first time I met Damian I almost stopped in my tracks. I don't know why. maybe it was because the first time I saw him was when I walked into a friend of a friend's apartment (he's my friend's friend's roommate) he had his shirt off and was working on his laptop. After that night I couldn't stop thinking about him and I heard (dang it, why didn't I put an away message for my instant messenger. That friend of mine that I was just talking about IMed me but I told her I had 10 minutes left so I'll talk to her later. probably about this assignment and because we've been discussing this Damian issue) through the grapevine that he was attracted to me too. The next time I went over there I didn't really talk to him much. but the third time I was sitting on a couch watching movies with them and he sat next to me and we could tell that the chemistry was definitely there. After that we started emailing each (okay taking the towel off of my head. or maybe not, my hair's not quite dry yet. I'll just unwrap it) other. Then the night two weeks ago that Michael went to a concert, I went to Damian's apartment with my friend and we all hung out. Nothing too spectacular. I didn't intend on staying over but I developed a paralyzing headache and by the end of the night I was so sick that I couldn't move, much less drive. The guys offered to let me stay at the apartment so I wouldn't have to drive home and the rest is history. I felt so guilty lying in bed with him though. He had asked me if he could get in bed with me and I said yes. I said yes. I didn't move away when he put his arm around me or when he started rubbing my back. I didn't look at him when he started pulling me closer to him but I didn't pull away either. I was very still when he kissed my forehead, but I didn't tell him to stop there. Why didn't I? Because I wanted it. But I have a loyal, devoted, loving, honest, wonderful boyfriend already. Why did I want this, or think I needed it? It was thrilling. Even though Damian was a bad kisser. It was like kissing a large mouth bass. Eventually I gave in and snuggled next to him with our bodies nicely intertwined. It wasn't really sexual. For the most part. This is making me sound horrible. I probably am horrible. Yeah, I am. This was cheating. And by not telling him and by still communicating with Damian via phone now and still email, I continue to be deceptive. Damian doesn't even want an attachment because he travels a lot for his job and may even be moving to London at the end of the year. And I don't love him. I don't really know him. I've hardly been around him except for three or four times. We've had two meaningful conversations. The whole concept of a relationship with him is silly. Yet I haven't been able to stop thinking about him since I met him and wondering about him, etc, etc. I just had to fix my towels because they were falling off of me (just got out of the shower before I started this). My palms are kind of damp, not good for a laptop probably. Okay, it's been more than 20 minutes so I'll stop now. I wonder why I wrote a confession of sorts. And I wonder if anyone will actually stop to read this. I'd better not save this, just in case Michael finds it. I'm terrible. "
"Today was fun. it was more fun than usual. Psychology is a fun class. I had more fun in than usual. Poor Tracy. I feel so bad for her. Why do guys treat her the way they do. She's such a good girl. If I were a guy, I would be happy to have a girl like her. maybe it's because at times she can be submissive. it seems like guys always want a challenge in life. How awkward. oh well I hope she transfers soon. I hate Judy. she's such a bitch. I dunno how she is going to become a psychologist. Gross. she's so insensitive and mean. i have no clue how she is going to become a psychologist. Aren't psychologists supposed to be nice, friendly, understanding, etc. ?? Well anyways. i just found another person with Charlie's birthday. i was reminded of him once again. Gosh he's such an asshole. i'm so happy I left him. i don't know what he's thinking. Why the hell would I ever want to get back with a shit head like him. He's so stupid. oh wells. i miss my mommy. it seems like I love her a lot lot more now that I'm away from home. I finally realize how much she loves me and devotes herself to me. oh well. i'm going to show her I love her a lot more eventually. i miss her so much. sometimes I wish I could just hold her and stuff but I guess not. Gosh this psycology class requires a lot of writing and etc. oh wells. wow I can't believe I met another Japanese girl like me. hehe. she's so nice and cute =) Anyways, I better study harder in all my classes or I'm going to completely fall behind in all my classes. the other Charles is stupid but he's fun to hang out with. why am I such an abusive person. it's like I always like to hit people and pinch them. oh well. Hung is really sad. well that's what Thao and Tracy says. what can I say. He shouldn't have said all the things he said. He's so dumb. typical guy I suppose. why did he say the things he said anyways. He really hurt my feelings. i may seem like I'm not a sensitive person, but I am so sensitive and some of the smallest things get to me. that really sucks. Grrrr!!! I hate my step dad. He's so superficial and stupid. i hope his son doesn't come to Houston and live with us. that would suck so bad. i really have no idea what I would do. He would definitely mess up the whole family. i wonder what Charles is doing right now. i wonder if he really does have feelings for me like he says. i wonder if he still thinks about me and stuff. He's such a dickhead. i bet h already slept with another girl already. Grrrr. what a damn loser. He's almost 24 years old yet he is still a junior. i really would not be suprised if I graduated before he did. hehe. michael is a really nice and cool guy. i'm glad I met him. i wonder if he is gay. that really sucks. guys who usually talk about their fatness usually seem to be gay. i have no clue though. i kinda miss Charlie pooh. oh well I must forget about him. i really need to catch up on my studies I must make a 4. 0 gpa so I can get into a good med school with scholarships and etc. Gosh Poor Catherine. i know her and Eric are having problems. it's just that she doesn't want to admit it. Everytime I bring the subject of him, she tries to avoid it like she doesn't care but I know she does. oh well Poor girl. i hope we have fun this weekend. that would be really great. Yup =) Ok now. it seems like I am running out of ideas to write for this class. i need a haircut bad. Hehe. oh my god I can't believe 90210 is still showing . that's pretty amazing. it's the 10th year since its been running. wow. Jenny Garth is still my idol. she's soo pretty and she dresses so nice and is skinny. i want to lose another 10 lbs. then I will be soo happy. the girl from party of 5 has really grown. i love her hair. thats the next haircut I'm going to have. it looks so nice. ok now. i think it's been 20 minuties and I'm tired of writing so I'm going to go now. byebye =) "
"Hi I'm Ben. I've been looking forward to this assignment since I heard of it. How often do I get a chance to get credit for babbling on a blank sheet of computer. I apologize. I can't spell to save my life and the point of this is to write not to write well. so anyway. I'm listening to emenem right now. I don't want to give the reader the impression that I'm into the popular mtv crap music that is so prevalent now, its just that it has a good beat and I can type fast to it. man I pity whoever has to read this. Let me ask you a question: have you ever considered that there isn't one universal reality but actually a different reality for every person on this planet. I was at a party this weekend and this thought was on my mind (no I wasn't high). I mean think about it. I'd go into this more but I'd have to stop typing and try to organize my thoughts more and that would just slow me down. I really like UT. that was on my mind. ok here comes the random babbling. I like Austin. people here are like no other on the planet. if ever a situation existed for an all out consciousness revolution it would be in Austin. so anyway, have you ever read any james joyce. he sucks. I can't stand him. I brought that up because he has the same weird ass choppy writing style that I'm using right now. I usually don't like to write like this. my papers usually make much more sense and my thoughts are much more clear. I suppose I could try to flub this and actually write instead of babble but I promised my roommates this would only take 20 minutes, they want to start a movie and they are waiting on me. wow that first 9 minutes really flew by. I'm a Japanese major. Now if you were wondering "" wow I wonder what this dorky lower classman's major is? "" you know. I feel bad that you have to read all this mental defecation. ok what am I thinking about now. I guess I'm thinking about the way I think, and I guess that's the point of this assignment. congratulations. I usually think in words. unless I'm inebriated then I think in pictures. I don't like thinking in pictures because things are so hard to communicate. hmm this is starting to get old, not to imply that I have a short attention span but I somehow pictured this differently. I thought about mapping all my thoughts about the previous thoughts on reality in general. now I've decided that is just to strange to submit to some stranger (no offense) in the psych department. Whoever reading this should read the principia discordia and the illuminatus trilogy. While I'm telling you what to do, you should vote for Gore. Aww here's something I can write about: politics. I hate and fear George bush. the fact that his slimy presence has to disgrace the great city of Austin is quite the insult. his Christian pro life beliefs coupled with his yen for the death penalty confuse and aggravate me. I rue the day the Christian right gain presidential power. I also am happy I worked ""rue"" into that last sentence. aww yeah. Well it looks like my writing time is coming to an end. I also played with the idea of getting hellasiously wasted before doing the stream of consciousness assignment. I'm glad I didn't this paper is crazy and disjointed enough already. ok well farewell random psych guy who read this. I will always hold a special place in my heart to you. well not really and that should relieve you. I promise you I'm not crazy. Well no more than anyone else. keep it real brother man. "
"       tj just got home and made his coffee. It smells good. I should have made coffee instead of drinking 3 cupsof Earl Gray tea because after two cups I have to pee every 10 to 15 minutes. Is it going to flood again. Looks like it is going to rain more. Ihope the tropical depression doesnt stall causing flooding again. We were sooo close last Nov. Itis about time for a nap. all this reading to do toady. That has to be completed today. My school schedule sucks. My work schedule sucks. Added together = triple sucking. I have NO reading time. I need to settle mom's affairs to that I don't have towork this semester. Rick will help me if the probate isnt over. He is truely manic depressive. His birthday upsetting him so he bought his 57 inch TV and now after the New Orleans deseaster his new Mercedes. Could it be from his Zoloft that he is taking for his premeture ejaculation condition?  If your mental state is fine and you takean anti depressant for a medical condition (non mental), can that cause a mental condition itself?  Was he trueful with me on the ture purpose for taking Zoloft?  Or, is he a scheemer?  The plane flying over triggered my thought that I can't beleive that it has already been a year since that traumatizing pictures on TV of 9-11. I have to pee already but I can't since this is timed. But I need to really badly, now that I thought of it. Dinner. What shall I make?  Should I save my time and just order Pizza?  I hope that my wallet that was stolen in New orleans arrives Monday. I hope that the receipts that I need to return those books are still in it. I am soo thankful that there are still good, honest people left in this world and that one found my wallet. He said that there was no money in it but what other stuff that was in the bill compartment is still there. I need to send that guy something as a thank you for your trouble to send it back to me. What should I send him?  Money for the acutal cost of sending my wallet to me and maybe a gift certificate, but from where?  I was soooo careful, making sure that my back pocket was buttoned at ALL times, almost like an obsession - constantly checking the button. Leson learned though, don't have your , never mind, strangers shouldn't have to read that thought. I hope nothing is wrong with my niece. I hope that she is not upset that I couldn't chat with her while typing this. Only 5 more minutes left. my laundy is ready to be taken out of the dryer. 4 minutes left to keep typing. I may have to restart the dryer to keep my clothes from wrinkeling. Why did I stop ironing all my clothes all the time. But it feels soooo good to not worry about little stuff like that anymore. I am pleased with the present me; although it is a VERY differnt me. Overall, I am pleased with the present. Getting over Moms death is comming along nicely. Still have my mommy moments though. I guess I always will. Im just glad that the urge to call her every sunday, like I have for years, has stopped. That was VERY irritating every sunday not getting to hear her voice. I miss her. But, thats the consiquence of love. Losing them one day. But man, the number of people that I have lost is astonishing. Damn you Reagan!!! so many deaths on your shoulder. "
"I am pretty tired today. I haven't had much sleep in the last couple of weeks. I have been working pretty hard and now with school starting it is going to be even busier. I work with the youth group at the church I go to. It is getting very busy there as well. We are really trying to get the numbers back up. After the summer the kids seemed to move away and the number of kids seemed to falter a little. Right now I am making a pot of coffee and getting ready to put in a hard day of studying. I was supposed to go to work today but there is nothing for us to do so we are staying home. We are working construction on our new church building. It is very exciting. We have to do a lot of demolition, and to help us out the fire department said they had some guys to train to breech walls. So for the last week they have been breaking through walls. It has been really cool to watch. My coffee smells really good. I am listening to some Audio Adrenaline. They are a Christian band I just downloaded. They sound pretty good, nothing that great about them though. I am switching majors this semester from Engineering to a dual major in History and Spanish, pretty drastic transfer huh?  I think it will be good. I got accepted into the UTeach program and so starting this semester I will be in an Austin public school teaching and observing. I will be in the classroom starting next week. I am very excited. My arms are getting really tired from writing so much and it has only been six minutes. I think they are going to fall off. I have a lot to do today. Since I am not working it will give me a good opportunity to catch up. I think I will be pretty far behind in this class PSY 301 because the Co-OP does not have the book(it is out of stock) They won't have it until Monday the 8th. I'll just have to read a lot next week. I need to do laundry today and maybe clean my truck. I am trying to sell my truck. It is a big beast and gets horrible gas mileage. About 10 miles per gallon. I think I will put it on Auto trader and see what I can get for it there. My coffee is done and it is calling my name. Come. Drink me. ""   I guess I will just have to wait another. oh my gosh. 10 minutes. I am losing my thoughts because my arms hurt so bad and I am really tired. I have to read six books for my History class. It's not so bad I have alreay read one of them and have started on another. The first was very boring. I think the rest will get better. This is a good song. I am also taking Chem 302 I think it will be a challenge because I don't really remember Chem 301 that well. I kind of breezed through it and didn't really learn any of the material. What other classes do I have?. I am trying to teach myself Spanish right now. It is fun. I think I can use Spanish a lot later in life. I hope to do some missionary work and maybe go into youth/college ministry. But who knows what the big guy has in store for me. College age has a lot of possibilities. I am hoping to maybe get something started this semester. I don't know how that is going to turn out but I think it will be fun. THis last summer me and a couple of friends went to Colorado did some fly fishing, landscape photography, and climbed Mt. Elbert (which is the highest peak in the Rockies @ 14,433)  It was a lot of fun. I and looking at a picture of me and my friend Chris. It is of when we went skydiving last year. That was a whole lot of fun. ""People may doubt what you say, but they will always believe what you do"". Reads a poster on my wall. I read it every day to help my fully realize how much more my actions speak than my words. I would like to be a great orator but if somebody could only know my through my life practices and not my life speeches I would want them to say that I had a heart like David "". a man after God's own heart. ""  That would be the testimony of my life. I pray that I can life according to the beliefs in which I so strongly hold. K2, Everest, Anapurna  some of the greatest peaks in the world. I someday wish to climb all of them. But we will see how things play themselves out. I think it is so funny how people grunt and groan and try to figure it all out. The things that are above. are always going to be greater than those below. And tru faith means you don't have to have all the answers. The End "
"The first thought that comes to my mind right now is about two of my little sisters. They are ages 4 and 7. I can't help but worry about them atleast five times a day. They live with my mother who is not exactly the world's best role model. I feel bad saying this, but it is true. She is not very strict, and it is easy to get away with the things that she says not to do. When I used to live with her I took advantage of this. I made terrible grades, lied all the time, sometimes for no apparant reason, and I did not take care of myself. Thank God I got out of that situation. I moved in with my father and my former stepmother. They got me out of my bad habits for the most part and without them I would never be sitting at this computer doing an assignment for a college course. Even after my dad and stepmom got divorced I still lived with her, I am so thankful that she has been here for me all these years. Getting back to my sisters, I am afraid that they will fall into the same habits I did and they are not as lucky as I was to have my stepmom. I can see them in the future missing out on so many opportunities because my mom won't keep them in line. I hope that I can be a positive influence on them, but it will be hard because I only get to see them about once a month. They are beautiful children with great personalities. Unfortunately Regina the 7 year old has already had troubles in school. I know this is not my mother's fault, because it seems as though she has some type of learning disability, but at the same time my mother doesn't spend any extra time working with her. Andrea the 4 year old is absolutely brilliant, I don't think she will have any problems in school unless she falls into the same pattern I did of lying and not doing her school work. I would never want to see my sisters move in with there dad though, because I am afraid that would make my mother feel as though she were a failure. I cannot imagine having three children and then having all of them raised elsewhere. I know she loves all three of us, and we are her life, and I love my mother very much also, but I just wish she would make more of an effort to make better lives for them. It would be a big help if she would just grow up a little bit, her mother still runs her life, and she cannot make decisions by herself. Overall she needs to work on herself first and then benefit the children from that. "
"Ever since I can remember, I have always had my friends. There's my best friend, Lisa, and then my other best friends Lindsey and Lexie. Ever since I was a baby, we have always been friends. We have all gone to school together and now we are all attending the same college. Before I found out I had gotten a scholarship to UT, I had been planning to go to Texas A&M. Me and Lisa would go to A&M and Lindsey and Lex would go to UT. Just thinking about splitting up for the first time in our entire lives can still make tears come to my eyes. NOw I will never know how it would have been.   Sometimes I do wonder how it would have been and sometimes I don't care because I'm so happy to still be with them. I realize that they are such a great part of me and my life. We all know each other so well. There is hardly nothing about them that I don't know and there is nothing about me that they don't know. To even say that they are my best friends does not express how much they mean to me. They are more than just friends. I don't know why, but somtimes I can't help but think about how lucky I am to have them. And at the same time, I know I take them for granted. I know that if I ever need anything, anything at all, that I can go to them and they will help me in a way that no one else can. I once heard this poem that simply explains my relationship with my friends. The poem may not be word for word, but I hope it is can better describe just how much I love my friends. First there was one. Then there was two. You came along and then there was three. A circle of friends, no beginning, no end. "
"guess ill just have to wait. atleast I can get this out of the way then. I'm so tired, but I think its that coffee from mojo's thats keeping me up. I have that song stuck in my head by aliyah. ""I got what you want, I got what you need, can I get another shot, this time I going to make it hot"", oh well, enough of that. I finally get to see salima again!!!! this friday!!!!! I can't wait after forever, I'm so excited. anyways, my hands are getting tired from typing this much, and its only been 2 mins. I'm going to go crazy, no way I can write like this for 20 mins. oh no, this sucks. oh well, nothing I can do, I have to stay awake for my laundry anyways. atleast my roommate eric stopped snoring now. and finally that damn pretesting crap worked. I finally got the confirmation sheet, now I'm set to go do some experimenting. hope nothing messes up though, I don't want to end up like the nutty professor or like in flubber or anything. its probably going to be easy, like analyzing dreams and crap like that. oh well. guess I shouldnt call it crap, I mean this is psychology class, I can't make fun of it in a psychology paper. that doesn't even make sense, I'm goin crazy, because my hands are HURTING!!!!! oh man, my eyes are closing, I'm fading fast, got to fight it, can't sleep, I can do it, then all I have to do is sleep in class tomorrow. oh, but I can't, I have . my ear itches. just scratched it. anyways, as I was saying. I have a damn quiz tomorrow, and the TA hasnt taught us anything. she's so sorry, I know more than her. but its those word problems that are messing me up. I can do the work just fine, just those word problems sound too complicated, and I get confused on what its asking me to do. oh well, hopefully there wont be any word problems to do. man this sucks. I'm bored, gloria is sleeping, so I can't chill in her room tonight and ""study"". salima is asleep, so I can't talk to her. kajal is being a bitch, so I don't want to talk to her even if she is awake. amar and ripal are both asleep, steve is probably awake, but he talks too much, so I don't want to chill with him. hopefully when I get off the computer gloria will have left me a voicemail telling me to come upstairs and chill with her. maybe she is awake, because I just called her and talked a little while ago. she said she was going to sleep, but oh well. she likes some other guy now, but thats ok, I already got what I wanted from her. but she's cool, we'll have other ""study"" sessions, I'm sure of it. she was pretty good though. oh well, can't get into that now, just in case somebody that shouldnt be reading this does. damn, not even 10 mins yet. I've never wrote this much so fast ever. its kind of cool, but weird at the same time. because none of it makes any sense and none of it flows, thats ok though, I guess thats the point of the assignment. now I'm wondering about what experiments I will be able to do. seems like fun. I can't wait. I'm excited because my check card came in the mail today. now tomorrow I have to go to the co-op and buy the solutions manual for calculus, because the TA doesn't know how to teach, and she's a aloser. I hope I'm typing everything fine. I'm trying to type with my eyes closed. lets open my eyes now and see how things went. hey, pretty good!!!  anyways, I hope fauzia brings me that paper in class tomorrow about selling your notes and all, it'll help out, I mean, every little bit counts!!! well I'm almost done know. its been 12 mins. so not too much to go. this kind of sucks, meghan and angela are coming on friday, in the evening, and I'm leaving for back to dallas in the afternoon. hopefully I can stop by baylor on the way back from dallas and check out the dorm room. we'll see what happens. man, now that I'm thinking about angela, gloria did the same stuff to me that she did, but gloria went farther. oh well, she looks a lot better than angela anyways, so I guess its better that way. ok, enough of that. I'm just really hoping we can do that kind of stuff later on also. ok, enough, for reals this time. man, my contacts are sticking, and they're causing my eyes to shut. oh well, hopefully when I'm done with this, the clothes will be done. that way I can get em out, and go to sleep, I havent had good sleep since I moved here. I got to wake up all early. and besides that I'm always awake, never sleeping. but I guess missing sleep last night was worth it, after what happened. hehehehehe. oh well, ill miss sleep for that any night of the week. I don't care about sleep when that is concerned. I was all sore last night from working out too, but I'm not going to let that stop me. hellz nooooo!!!!!  I'm still a bit sore, because we started working out on saturday. its starting to wear off, so I'm getting used to working out, I just hope we stick to working out everyday, because I need it. but I kind of like that sore feeling, because atleast then you know you're doing something, and that something is improving. man, this is loooonnnnnggg, but its ok, I doubt anybody will even read it. I guess its just like a completion grade. man its hard to have your words and all agree with me. don't just play with me like that. well actually, you can play with me anyway you want. oh good, only 2 more minutes than I get get ready to hit the sack. 1 minute!!!! this is weird its like a countdown for newyears, but hena didnt make a big deal about leaving. I wish salima understood more and didnt cry as much as. whoa, just opened my eyes REAL wide, now I can see, and I see that it has been over 20 mins, so I am done. bye bye "
"I hate computers. I think I hate them because I do not understand them. This assignment is hard because I am trying not to think about the assignment and just write about what is in my head. Why is this just continuing on one line?  Am I doing this wrong?  Should I fix the grammatical errors that I make?  I feel stressed I have only been here for a couple weeks. What could I possibly be stressed about?  I need to talk to Ashton. I need to talk to him tonight. This is a time in my life where I am supposed to try new things, meet new people, further my education. I do not need a serious boyfriend now. Why is he so nice?  Did he see this coming?  Is he trying to make this harder for me?  No. What am I talking about?  He is always this nice. He is such an incredible guy. Bad timing. This always happens to me. I will not miss experiences in college like I did in high school because of some guy. I need to see what it is like not having some guy around me all the time. Josh might be right. I might be afraid of being by myself. I will talk to him tonight. I probably will not. How can I possibly be mean to someone who is so wonderful?  He won't understand. I know this is the best thing for me. I need to learn how to operate e-mail. I want to start sending mail to my brother. Josh better come to Austin to see me soon. My sister better come soon, too. I cannot believe that the one weekend I really want to go home (homecoming) I have to stay here and be formally initiated into my sorority. It is Haley's birthday. I am so Jealous that Meredith gets to go see everyone and I will not. We have been talking about how fun that weekend will be since homecoming last year. This sucks. Everyone will be home. I wish the girls in this dorm were a little more considerate. They see me studying in here and they are still so loud. I hope I do not do the same thing. I am having so much fun here, yet I am still stressed about maintaining my friendships with my best friends from home. I hate it that one of my best friends is here in Austin. It puts such a damper on our friendship. I am just so busy right now. I never realized how much time this sorority would take up. Am I neglecting one of best friends?  Does she resent the fact that I am making new friends?  I love that girl. With everyone else, we know why we haven't seen one another. Ashton. What am I going to do?  I am having to talk myself into doing this. I know I need to see what it is like to date other people. I think Richard has something to do with this. I think Ashton is so wonderful because Richard was so horrible. I wonder what Richard is doing. I wonder if he is ended up going SAE. I wonder if he has a girlfriend. I wonder if he is a possessive weirdo to her. Why do I care?  No, Ashton is wonderful. Am I going to regret this?  What if he starts dating someone else and it breaks my heart. I need to do this. I am so far behind. I need to learn a little about time management. I think I am getting sick. I keep feeling like I am about to sneeze. I need to quit smoking. I would like to smoke right now. Why do I think when I am stressed that a cigarette will make me feel better. I should talk my father into buying me a computer for Christmas. I think that would be a good idea. I am going to be here for a while. I really need to start thinking of what it is that I want to do. Am I taking pointless classes?  Do I always ask myself questions?  I was really insulted by those stupid papers that basically said that I was in the lowest percentile of students at this university. I have to do well this year. I need to get my act together. It is so hard to just sit in my room and study. I should probably spend more time at the library. What could I be distracted by there?  I am asking myself too  many questions. I need some sleep. I think I am going to sneeze again. I hate that feeling.           "
"I really don't now exactly what to write. my mind is just blank. I met this really hot guy at my dorm and I want to keep talking to him. he doesn't remind me of Rain Meada at all but what can I say. my vision is blurred today probably because of the ozone warnings. I can't believe that it was 112 degrees the other day. I wish that I would have made the dance team, but I guess I knew that I wouldn't. I really want to change my major. I hate ballet with a passion and today I felt sick to my stomach in class because I hate it so much. brandon makes me so mad because he acts gay all the time. what is up with him and jennifer, why don't they just date or something. I wonder if jen really likes jansen or what. I really want a boyfriend. I dreamed about kevin last night and it was so weird because he was actually being nice. I was sick and in the hospital or something and he was taking care of me. I want to meet justin timberlake so bad. I just want to have sex with him. I miss my brother and I can't believe that my father hasn't called me in over 3 months. And he didn't even come to my graduation. ugh. I really don't like my classes and I already have trouble getting myself to class. I am such a bad student. I wonder where sammy is today? I really want him back but that will never happen. I pretend that there is a chance but I am kidding myself now that he is with mrs. perfect. jen lovey. I don't know that pisses me off so much I want to scream. I think it was the same guy in class today that said mating choices that asked who was single the first day. I will have to go and meet him. I'm hungry and I feel extremely fat. I was thinking today about why people swing their arms when they walk. that reminds me of seinfeld and when Elaine makes fun of the woman who doesn't swing her arms. I think I like patobut I'm not really attracted to him. I wonder if you can actually like someone as in love if you aren't attracted to them. maybe I am and I just don't want to admit it. the mind is so weird. It psychs you out to think one thing but then you get all confused because you don't know if that is what you really think. that was complicated. I feel bad that I have not made time for God in my life and I want to but then I find fun things to do and forget. I need to pray about that. I can't wait to meet the man that I'm going to marry. I'm looking at this picture of my best friend from high school and not one thought comes to my head. sometimes I think that it was good we went our own ways because we were getting tired of each other. I feel bad for casey and I really need to call daniel. patrick is the rudest boy in the world. I don't think he has ever been nice to me. Oh well his loss. I am so broke right now. I need to get a loan but the stupid texas thing is gay and won't work. I wonder if my finger is broken or not. I can't decide if I want to try out for the ut dance team or not. what is up with all my homework. I never have a life anymore. I think I'm really going to hate school. maybe I will drop out and go back home and work at heb. my life is going nowhere. its not like I'm actually going to dance on broadway so what's the point of even trying for it. I hate writing journals for dumb modern class. That's a bunch of crap. this school is so messed up with all its procedures and freaking lines that are always miles long. my feet are killing me. I need to go to the chiropractor. where is melissa. what is she doing? I'm thinking that this is the easiest writing assignment I've ever done. my English teacher mrs. dillard ran away with another teacher and got married and I never saw her again. that was strange. and my dad did that too. he told me in a mexican food restaurant and I wanted to kill him. oh and the orange drink that we used to drink and the wasp that was trapped in the house and I started crying. my dog died when I was little. I miss my cat at home but I don't want to go home and see my mom. she will drive me crazy. brittney spears is such a hoe. if she slept with justin that is gross. I want to meet him and ask him. I think I will. Birmingham is going to be tight. the drive sucks but to meet him I would do anything. man I just want to know what it would be like to kiss him. ohhhh, dang I can't wait. I want to talk to zal. I wonder if he is back from paris yet? I think I'm don't know so yeah. "
"     I am very excited, but anxious to be in this new city, Austin. It is overwhelming right now solely because I don't know everyone here and am still meeting new friends. I enjoy all my classes but know that this semester will probably be very strenuous. My goal is to work hard and try my best to not get caught up in the social life and to focus on what is most important, my grades. I am feeling a little homesick though, because I am out of my comfort zone and surrounded by all new faces. I miss my family a little, and my boyfriend a lot. I am excited to be here, but feel a little left out sometimes. Everyone knows eachother and I sometimes feel alienated. I am listening to cars floor by my dorm room window. Which causes me to lose concentration at times. It is also hard when the girls here are screaming and running through the halls. Especially at night when they come running in all drunk. I smell flowers all throughout our room because we have received so many from pledging Theta. My roommate and I just got through with Rush and are excited about our new sorority. I know it will give me a chance to branch out and meet new people, which will be nice. I am noticing, though, that most of the girls here are pretty clicky. It is hard to make friends when they are all always going off together in little groups. Im not the type of person who is usually affected by those little things, but being without my boyfriend and my hometown friends makes things a little more difficult. I realize though, being here will teach me how to become a more independent person and that I will have to learn to adjust when things don't always work out the way they seemed too. I love the condition of our room right now also because my roommate is a pretty clean person which makes me a pretty clean person. Our room is all tidy and neat. I know my mom would be happy. I really love this city of Austin. It is so fun and such a party place. It also seems to me to be a bit overwhelming. I'm not all into this every night party life. Don't get me wrong I love to party and all, but to a certain extent. I'm a christian too which makes living here kind of difficult. You become so wrapped up in all the constant parties and b. s. that you sometimes forget who you really are. One thing I want to do while at school here for the next 4 years is discover who I really am. When you take away all the parties and superficialness. what is left? I want to make something of myself in school and in my personal life. I am contemplating on whether I want to go out tonight with the girls or stay in and go to bed early. It seems like im always on the go here, too. There is always something to do and barely ever any time to simply relax. As you can probably tell i am a little stressed out. I notice it is getting more quiet in our dorm now because the girls have all left to go out. My computer just froze for the longest time so for about 5 minutes I couldn't write. So i am going to start again, because for 5 more minutes and finish my time. sorry. anyways, i am really frustrated now because my computer has been having so many problems lately. It is making me very aggravated. So in case you know this I am still typing after the 20 min time period, because 5 of my minutes were taken away because of this stupid computer. Well, I am hoping that I will learn my away around Austin soon because this city is very confusing. I just want to have a notion of where everything is. I hate not knowing my way around places. Well, I am going to end it now because I timed an extra 5 min on my clock and it is up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     j                                                                                                                                                                                              m                        y                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          "
"I just got out of your class after watching the video and I was disappointed that I couldn't do a personality survey. I really wanted to do one. I like to find out things about myself that I might not have been aware of . yesterday I bought a postcard that had my horoscope sign and a description of the characteristics people of this sign have and I thought, as it usually turns out to be, that this card just about pin pointed a lot of the qualities that I have of course a few things were off the mark for goodness sake we are more complex than a few words that tell everyone born within a certain time span who they are, what they should be like, and what they would be good at. I'm really tired I wish I could fall asleep and not have to worry about any assignments. gosh we have to read for every class every day. I'm also taking sociology so a lot of the stuff in psy are the same, but obviously both sciences don't agree. I wonder how I'm going to keep all the facts straight. my soc teacher is boring cause he teaches straight from the book he makes me sleepy at 3:00 in the afternoon how is that possible?  my other classes are cool because teachers teach from the book but insert their own ideas an anecedotes. which I like a lot. I wish I knew how to approach my professors and to just talk to them. I enjoy talking to people but classes this big don't really allow you to. I'm also intimidated by the professors for goodness sake we can no longer say miss or Mr. now its Dr. I am so not used to that. I feel so dumb and in awe by them. maybe that's why I can't figure out a way to approach them. one of my instructors on the first day of class called on me first and I was kind of sleepy and gave a partially correct and that sounded stupid and I heard people giggle. gosh I felt dumb. I still can't forget about it. it's like one of those experiences that everyone else forgets except you and you still think they remember. twenty minutes of writing is a lot of time but I just looked at my watch and I only have 3 minutes to go. I love psy. I love to give advice and find out people's personalities but ironically I'm not trying to pursue a career in that. maybe later I'll change my mind and do it  who knows. all I want is to graduate but it's no longer like high school. now I'm not sure if I'm capable of succeeding. I want to succeed but with A's and without having to  study so much. high school spoiled me got used to getting by with out studying. but now it's a whole new adventure. "
"Okay for 20 minutes hopefully it will go by relatively fast. I have so much to do today studying, and going to workout will probably consume the rest of my day. But I am finally settling into a routine, it's taken a couple of weeks but I am getting the hang of college life. Most of my friends are going home for the weekend but it's too soon for me. I want to stay, besides I went to Dallas last weekend for Labor Day for my sister's birthday. I got to see my best friend Zach who is now in Colorado trying to wrestle. But I am not anxious to go home just yet, especially since I will there the first weekend of October for TXOU and the Santana concert. Then later that month my mom and my sisters will be coming to see me here at school. My oldest sister Maggie is bringing her new fiance. I haven't met him yet, but he must be a good guy if she has chosen to marry him she of all people would not stand to be burnt twice. They both have to go get annulments from their previous marriages so they can be wed in a Catholic church. Catholicism is kind of funny that way I come from a very strong Catholic family and my father would rather have preferred me to attend the University of Dallas which is Catholic and not Liberal UT. However, my parents strategically placed my in Dobie, next to the university Catholic center. Smart people. Little do they know the last time I went to church was when I was in Dallas. My dad also really pushes me to become a doctor which is what I have wanted to do for the majority of my life. But last spring, architecture was really introduced to me and now I am in Dean Speck's architecture class which is fascinating I love it. Who knows when I'll figure out what I want to do, I do have the feeling that no matter what I decide to do that I'll probably endure some sort of midlife crisis and completely change my career. But that's okay with me, there are a lot of people who do that. My sister Jennifer, for example, is 29 and is about to take her LSAT and apply to law school. She is even applying to UT Law that would be cool if she was down here too. I like being on my own though and not really having the responsibility of worrying about her. It's not that she places that responsibility on me but I am the closest to her out of my family so I am usually the one in the middle trying the best way to help her alcoholism and depression. Yeah, she's applying to law school. At least she has some sort of direction. It's hard for her to hear the truth. But I slammed it down her throat this summer and I think it hit her. I wonder when Kim is getting home. I think she said 5:00. I like having the whole suite to myself though I can actually get some stuff done. We have to go later to the house and put in some study hours with Reese. Reese is probably lonely without Jessica around to bug her. I hope I get her as my Diamond Sister, that would be really cool. Kim is going home this weekend along with the rest of the world to see Dave Matthews Band one of my favorites. I have seen them in concert before and tickets are expensive so I don't think I am going to go. Unless my boyfriend can find some relatively good priced lawn tickets not likely. I'd like to see everyone then again it's too soon to come home. I miss my dog. It took me 17 years to get a dog and I finally get the most perfectly adorable black lab and I leave for school. I'll probably breed labs when I'm older I love Labs and I don't see why I'd ever have any other kind of dog. My suitemates are really organized I am typing on Amy's computer and I'm noticing how clean her desk isooh, I'm done! "
"I can't believe he just showed up like that and expected me to let him in of course I let him in anyway. What is this control he has over me? I can't make thoughts work clearly when he looks at me. All I see are blue eyes and red hair. Deep, deep blueness. There I get lost into submission. Is it me? Is it all just something I do to myself? Where are the lines I should be drawing. Why isn't easier to know what the right thing to do is? I wonder if he's sleeping right now? I know he's home. Maybe I should knock on his window until he wakes up and lets me sleep next to him? His room is so close just right down stairs. I know he look up at me every night through his window. He's sees everybody I let in. I'll have to remember in the future the consequences of sleeping with neighbors; but what if they have crazy red hair and perfect hands? It will be an interesting year. I wonder if he'll end up hating me? or me him? no. we can at least be friends. Although, it's hard sometimes. Especially with the angel downstairs. Ha! no pun intended. I just don't understand where all the anger inside him comes from. We're so different. I'm so full of love and he's so scared of love. Maybe he just fearful and that's why he becomes so overwhelmed with anger; or maybe he's just passionate. I think that might be part of it. I read his palms and his heart line was off the chart! He asked me when I met him if I thought we'd be dangerous together and I said, ""I'm not dangerous with anybody,"" but I'm begging to change my mind. I wish I could see inside him. Usually I can read strait through boys, but he is an enigma. I guess I'll just start looking harder. If I go down there right now I know he'll wake up and be happy to see me. I'm sure he thought about me all night after the afternoon we had together. Why is it that you can see someone who fits every requirement you have for the perfect mate, but if there's no chemistry there's no relationship  at least romantically. Then you might met someone who isn't your type at all, maybe you don't even really like the same music or have the same lifestyle, but if there's chemistry you can't resist each other. Who casts the spells on us? Who laughs at our bumbling confusion? Is it all a matter of having the ideal children? Are the people we have 'chemistry' with the people who have the perfect complementary set of genes to our own? If so, how does my body know? Do my electrons match up perfectly with the spin cycles of theirs? "
"As I sit her and begin this assignment so many things come to mind. I feel overwhelmed with things I need to do, but I'm glad I'm getting this assignment completed at last. My watch is bugging me it continues to hit against the desk. If I only could get and stay comfortable I could get so much more done. I feel  like I make to many excuses, yet I always get done what I need to get done. I miss home, not completely. I don't want to be there now, for no one is there friend wise really, but I just miss the security. I can't wait till I'm busier here at school. There is so much I want to do. There is a smudge on my computer screen, just enough that the words beneath it are  a little blurred. I wonder where the name Bevo came for the mascot of UT. Names are so funny. I mean who comes up with them. My name is strange and unique. People always ask me how I got it. I know it is derived from my grandfather's name, but I don't know how they logistically came up with it. Is Logistically a word. I doubt it . I'm always coming up with words like that.  I had the best weekend. It was a lot of fun. I got to spend some time with friends I hadn't seen in a while. I only wish it wasn't so rushed. We were constantly doing stuff. I just wanted to hang out and chill, but Oh no we had to party non-stop. I don't drink so I feel as if I'm not always that much fun. I know that is stupid. But that's how I feel.  Feelings are so weird they suck sometimes and are awesome other times. They are so demanding. I mean whatever you are feeling takes so much energy be it positive or negative. I feel lonely now. But I'm glad. I need to spend time with myself. but I'm the kind of person that can't stand being alone. That's something I'm going to have to work on.  I played soccer in high school. But I had surgery my senior year and couldn't play. I kinda want to play again, but I'm worried I'll suck since it has been so long. I cant believe I've used the word, ""suck"" so many times that is so rude and un-lady like. excuse me. Well I don't even know who I'm apologizing to. I just know if my mother knew I used that word she would have a few words with me.  I just realized I need to flip my calendar. I can't believe it is already Sept. It seams like just yesterday summer was here. I'm not as good of a typist as I used to be, I keep hitting the wrong keys, or should I say striking the wrong keys.   Typing is a lot like playing the piano you strike keys in a planed out order to create something. It's kind of neat when you think about it. Everything is like that. A lot of little things put together is what creates the whole picture, piece of music or art. I can't wait to get married. Well that's not true. I can wait to get married but I can't wait to find My soul mate. I believe God intended for us to only be with one person, and that person was created for us, just like we were created for them. Well anyway I can't wait to meet him. I miss my cat. I remember the professor mentioned writing about our animals, and that made me think of my cat. I love him. He is so cute and inviting, I don't think he has ever met a stranger, or an enemy. It would be nice if there were more people like that.  I hope I don't get that carpal tunnel disease or whatever from typing incorrectly, that would not be good. I miss my friends, but most of all my best friend he is so awesome, but he's not dealing with this whole separation thing well, or maybe I'm not dealing with it well and he is doing just fine. Either way I'm not happy with the situation. I think I have the wrong edition book for my psychology book. I hope it doesn't make a difference. I guess I will find out tomorrow. A rose is so beautiful. I just spotted a picture of one. It is so symbolic. How It's beauty is dangerous to the touch. An important lesson to be learned and cherished, well I've been at this for just over twenty minutes now so I think I'll call it quits. But his was fun. "
"     I feel like I am under a lot of stress right now at this time. All that I have been doing is wondering if I am going to make it through college alright. I am very hungry at this time. I do not know if I will get something to eat right after I am done with this assignment or if I will wait until I have done some other homework from another one of my classes. I know that I will have to get something very soon because I can smell the food that my friend is eating over there in the corner. I smells sooooo good that my stomach feels like it will never stop making the noises that it is making until I give some food to it. I feel sort of tired at this point in the day. I have just recently finished all of my classes which begin early in the morning and do not finish until late in the afternoon. That is sort of a good thing because I get a big break in the middle of the day, but I would rather get my school day over with early so that I could do homework at any time that I want to instead of being forced to do it right after class. The reason that I have a schedule that is this way is because I went to one of the last sessions of orientation and I did not get the times for the classes that I wanted. Right now my eyes are sort of getting tired because I am not used to typing for this many minutes straight without a single break. Usually when I type I will take a lot of breaks and I will waste a lot of time that I should not be wasting. Therefore, I guess that this is a beneficial assignment because it is teaching me something that I am not used to doing. There are many assingments that I am not used to doing that I have had to do for all of my classes. I get a lot of math homework, which is something that is completely different from high school. Back in high school I really did not have that difficult of a time with the work that I was given. I feel now that I will have to work very hard to attain grades similar to my high school ones. The reason that I figure this is because I have talked to many people that used to go to the University of Texas. Some say it is not that hard, but the majority of the people that I talk to say that I will have to work my tail off if I want to be at the top. They have said that everyone is just as smart as me at this school. I feel that this fact is a good thing. I like to be challeged against others who are at the same level as me or above. I feel that if I work hard that I can do anything that my mind imagines. I think that all people should have that kind of confidence because everyone in this world is worth something. Maaaannnn, I am really really really hungry because that food smells really good. I think that I am going to go and get something to eat after I finsh this assignment. I may have a burger or a few tacos or something. Whatever I get to eat, I know that it will be delicious because my stomach is turning and wishing for something to be put in it right now. I forgot to tell myself that my left foot hurts a whole lot. Yesterday I dropped a big can on the top of my foot and it swelled up a little bit and it still kind of hurts when I walk for a long time on it. I know that if I just gave it a little time to rest that it would probably be fine, but I have an active life and I really cannot do that. "
"I'm feeling pretty good after my jog, but I usually do. I haven't worked out in two weeks; therefore, I was a little surprised that I could still jog the mile. I'm a pretty slow jogger. When I jog, I usually have company--either one friend or another. It's cool when I jog with friends that have about the same speed I do; that way, I don't get burnt out after jogging for only a short distance. In the summer I used to jog with some friends who had much longer legs than I do, and they were more fit. They used to joke that I had to jog two steps for every step that they took. That's good though, I'm getting the better work out. I used to have dreams about jogging and working out before I actually did start exercising regularly. In one of my dreams, I dreamt that I was running forever and it felt really good--I didn't get tired or anything. This past summer, I experienced something kind of like my dream. I jogged straight for  thirty minutes without stopping. When I was down, my muscles felt like jello!  Also this past summer, I didn't do much but go to summer school and work on my craft projects. I used to watch these do-it-yourself shows on PBS when I was little and I guess a part of me has always wanted to try some of the ideas out. In the past couple years, I've begun to do some craft projects on my own. My friend Tina wonders why I would buy so many supplies. I like the variety and after I make something, I usually give it away. so it's not like I'm keeping a dozen replicas of something in my apartment. I do use a lot of the things I made to decorate my apartment. without them, my apartment would look emptier than it already does. I don't have a couch right now, but my parents are coming up this weekend and I think we are supposed to buy a futon. that would be really neat. I've never had a futon before. I went to the Texas union last night and my friends and I saw a bunch of for sale signs for futons and sofas. I might have to go ahead and buy one of those if I don't get a futon this weekend. my friend peter said he'll take me furniture shopping too, at some thrift store. I don't want to buy any new couches right now because it'll be such a big hassle when I have to move out. for this coming summer, a couple of my best friends invited me to room with them if they stay up here for summer school. if I do that, then I can move some of my furniture into the apartment we share. "
"    Twenty minutes seems like a really long time to do this assignment. I don't really feel like sitting here that long. I'm sleepy. I guess I shouldn't have waited until the last minute to do this assignment. If I would have finished it yesterday, (like I planned) instead of going to sleep, I wouldn't be sitting here now. Hopefully I won't fall asleep in class. Especially my history class- it's kind of boring. I didn't finish this week's reading either. The professor said we're not having a discussion, so I'm really not worried about it. I'm tired of typing. I know I'm just supposed to be typing my thoughts, but all that's on my mind is other things that I could be doing with my time right about now- like SLEEPING. I really want to go to back to sleep. I really don't have time to go back to sleep either because I have a class in less than an hour. I wonder if we're getting our accounting quizzes back today??  I don't think I did very well. It's completely my fault though because I only did half of the reading and half of the homework. I wonder how Julianne and Tiffany did?  Tiffany's birthday is tomorrow. The other Tiffany invited me. I'm not sure what's going on exactly, but we're supposed to be doing something. Tiffany is a trip!! She's funny though. She lives in Jefferson Commons, but Mike and Porter don't really know her. I'm glad she came to choir rehearsal. She can sing. I don't think she needs to be in the alto section, but I don't think she's going to move either. Hopefully, she'll try out for a solo. I haven't heard her REALLY sing, but I don't think that   Bless Me   is too high for her. I'm so sleepy. I'm really excited about Innervisions though. I was glad to see so many new faces. I don't feel very well. I think I'm just tired. I should have gone to bed last night, instead of sitting up and talking all night. I didn't want to say anything because that's my friend, but his room smelled like old popcorn and feet. After I stopped and thought about it for a minute, I think that was pretty accurate. I'm only half/focused on this. I'm bored already. I'm looking up random people in the UT directory. Twenty minutes is a long time to just sit and type thoughts. My sister's birthday is tomorrow. I want to go home, but I really don't feel like driving. I talked to my mom yesterday, and she said that I didn't have to come. I want to go, I just don't want to drive. I may go home the weekend of my birthday. Initially, my parents planned to come to Austin, but I haven't heard anything about parents's weekend, so I don't know if that's still going to happen or not. Since it's 2 weeks away, I need UT to let me know something so that I can plan accordingly. I want to go home so that I can eat. I want some boudain, Court Buillion, and a fried turkey. Those things don't really go together (at all) but that's what I want. I want to go to Brady's Landing too!! That restaurant is the bomb. I would like to go on a Friday, but I don't think that's possible. I'll be teaching Pump da Word, so I won't be able to make it back to Houston before 11 or 12. Oh well, I guess I'll figure it out later. Yes!!! only 2 more minutes to go!!!!  I'm not sure what to talk about for the remainder of the time. I'll just ramble for a while. Cedrick rambles sometimes. I love him, but he can talk and talk for long periods of time. I had lunch and dinner with him yesterday. It was cool. Cedrick is one of the good guys. He talks about his girlfriend all the time (I'm jealous). I wish I had somebody, but God is still in control. He'll give me my wife in His own perfect time. "
"     hello professor, I'm doing your little writing assignment even though I have no clue what to write so Ill do what you said to do and wirte about anything that comes to my head. today I have to do a lot of study work, not much else to do b. C I lifted weights and played bball yesterday for bout 6 hours and now I'm in the UT cycling team and its pretty damn cool. I should excel in this sport because I know how to push my body harder than anyone I know, no matter what the test I always push my body harder than everyone else. I want to be the best no matter what the sport or event. I should also be good at this because I love to ride my bike and to do it as a sport? wow lots of fun. music. hmmm I like it a lot, I have lots of it in fact I have about 15 GB of music on this computer which is about 5,000 songs so I have a wide variety of music and that's good to have, its also good to have know a lot of things which is exactly what I do, I know lots of stuff that nobody else would know. I am extremely good at jeopardy and I usually have as much money as the winner and the funny part about it is, they have had college and lots of schooling, most of the contestants were graduate students and I have just begun college. by the way my classes are in no way difficult, I hope your class doesn't get hard because I have a a lot of calculus which isn't hard, just very time consuming. what to write, haha now that I ask an opportunity has presented itself, a girl that I know just said hi, got me some of that last weekend, I've known her all my life and she looks pretty good too, she goes to tarleton(redneck city) but its ok, its still good. I have a way with people, if I can talk to them for about 10 minutes I can get them to really like me and if I want to I can make them do almost anything(no alchohol has to be used). you can ask my best bud who goes to school here, he knows that I have a way with people and I do that's what's so cool about this. I have a great life ahead of me and I want to live it to the fullest and no matter what I say on here I can't stop typing so I will continue and the music is great by the way damn I've got to go home this weekend, everyone misses me too much although I don't miss any of them except this girl that I went out with for bout 2 years, lots of fun there, I love her yes I do and she loves me but since I left we broke up and now she's trapped with a druggie b. C if she dumps him he will either kill himself or me so she's very scared but I don't care, it will all work itself out in time I just hope it won't take forever. my calculus teacher is skin a real social reject, he has no body mass, he is skinnier than a toothpick and his clothes almost fall off of him its funny to look at that finish button is looking really good right now, as in extremley good, I wish I could click it right now but I can't b. C my 20 isn't finished yet so I will continue in my efforts to type and type continuously like you wanted, geez 20 minutes is a long time to just type and have nobody type back to you although I have writted letters that have taken me 3 hours to write and consisted of about 10 pages of paper, but I don't care, I don't care about much anyways, just my grades got to keep them up, I care about my family my future and the girl back home, I care about my frineds, I care about my physical health and looks that's why I love to be in shape but other than that, I don't care about much of anything, there is no reason to care and by the way I SUPPORT BUSH he is a good man and if the media didn't give him such a hard rap about things people would like him a lot more the only reason many people don't is because of the media, I even ask them why they don't like him and all they can say is just because, I reeally wisht tthat they would take the time to research things and see who the btter candidate for the president is which is obviously BUSH!!! anyways I don't really liek the music that is playing right now its not really that cool and has no good beat at all, music is a beautiful artform wchich I believe is the best ever but who cares? nobody. I am out to change the world and I will you will see  --Mad Hatter--out "
